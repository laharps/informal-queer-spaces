# Informal Queer Spaces

## Who are we?
Michael Criste and Lauren Harper -- gay hacking urban planning nerds

## What are we doing?
We are attempting scrape reviews from Yelp (or something similar) to identify informal queer spaces. 

# Why are we doing this?
We're gay and we need more places to hang out. Also, we have to pass this class.
