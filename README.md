# Informal Queer Spaces

Our goal is to better understand the changing landscape of queer spaces in the United States. To accomplish this, we have utilized natural language processing tools learned over the course of the quarter on the Yelp academic dataset to identify queer-serving, queer-friendly, and queer-owned businesses in the Philadelphia Metropolitain region. 

Please see the Final Notebook for an aggregated narrative of our process. If you prefer to view our individual process notebooks, these can be found in the Intermediate Notebooks folder. 

## Who are we?
Michael Criste and Lauren Harper -- gay hacking urban planning nerds

## What are we doing?
We are attempting scrape reviews from Yelp (or something similar) to identify informal queer spaces. 

## Why are we doing this?
We're gay and we need more places to hang out. Also, we have to pass this class.
