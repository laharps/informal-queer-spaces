Aesthetically speaking, a gay sports bar is a genius concept.  Finally, someone has combined the latent homoeroticism of professional athletics with actual homoeroticism.  It was a long time coming, but I hope it will inspire many more.

It was really nice to go to a bar where you didn't have to worry about ordering another drink every 5 minutes.

Although the service was friendly and prompt, we were lured in by the promise of an ""award-winning"" drag show and ""complementary Grey Goose cocktails.""  There was a $17/person cover charge, which was a pretty good deal for downtown Philly on NYE, especially if some drinks are included.  What they didn't mention until after we paid the cover was that 1) there was actually no seating available for the show, and the live video feed (SD, not HD) of the show was in TVs in another room which also had minimal seating (standing room only most of the time); and 2) the complimentary ""cocktails"" were actually 1oz. shots that came around every hour or so.  And I'm not sure what authority issued the award for the ""award-winning"" drag show, but it was pretty amateur in our opinions.  HUGE bait and switch y'all.  Not cool.  We left after an hour, $34 down and one shot each to show for it.  

NOW, all of that having been said, I think we would have had a totally different experience if it hadn't been NYE.  The bar staff was super nice, and the drinks were reasonably priced for what you get.  Moreover, there really aren't a lot of gay sports bars out there, so props to the management for putting together a decent, attractive venue.

My favorite thing about this place however is the food. Everything I've had so far satisfies my craving for bar food and the affordable prices make it more delicious. Some of my favorites are the wings and the sliders. The traditional sliders come on a slab of wood with 3 perfect round indentations for the sliders to sit on. Each bite has a nice char grilled taste that oozes with cheddar and a kick of a pickle.

Thought these are the only kind of sliders I've ordered, there are others to choose from. It'd be nice if there was an assorted option on the menu to try all the sliders, but I guess that means I'll have to return for more.",2011-05-03 05:45:59

How could you forget right?

Whoever transformed this spot into Tabu did a remarkable job! I was upstairs for karaoke on a Monday night, enclosed in the same four walls I used to go to Broadzilla dance parties every week and drink Sparks until my tongue turned orange, and it was hard to believe.

It's got a nice, loungey atmosphere and is perfect for you and ten of your friends.

The bartender was friendly, and when the barback cleared my and my friends' drinks by accident, she made a couple more, no questions asked. She even sang karaoke and well!

Sara Sherr hosts karaoke all over the place on any given night of the week, but so far I've most enjoyed it at Tabu.

They also have ""Three Dollar Sundays"" and games nights, making it one of the most affordable bars in the ""Gayborhood.""

Downstairs houses a pool table and the ground floor has tables and seating for the bar crowd.  Sports games play on the many flat-screen TVs, and a jukebox plays a wide variety of tunes.

The food is also affordable yet delicious.  Typical bar food gets a face lift with creative combinations of flavors and a wide variety for the discerning palette.  A lump crabcake sandwich is served with hunks of blue-claw crab and spicy mayo and a side of potato salad, and can also be ordered as sliders for an appetizer.  The same goes for the lovely Kobe beef burgers served on potato rolls with aged cheddar.  The presentation was so adorable it was almost a shame to eat it.  Tabu Nachos are piled high and must be shared, topped with roasted corn, beans, jalapeno, sour cream, salsa verde, and fresh guacamole.

They had to go print them out.  This took 30+ minutes.  The choices were extremely limited.  Most of us got our food about a half hour later, although some of us did not eat for an additional 45 minutes.  At first we waited for everyone to be served, but eventually we couldn't wait for then any longer because the food was getting cold.

The ""drag queen and burlesque"" show was over an hour and 45 minutes late to start, and it was TERRIBLE.

Anyway - so the fall menu has rolled out. Praise the excellent managers who listened to our wails over the loss of our beloved tater tots. Not only did they bring them back, but with a full range of toppings available. Check out my pictures to see a few examples of the NINE types of tots that they offer. 

In addition, the burgers have also gone through a revamp. Large 1/2 pound patties cooked as rare (or as well) as you like them topped with some really inventive ingredients. From the simple yet delicious Freddy (the burger, not the manager, the manager is more complex and I cannot attest to how he tastes), with peanut butter and bacon, to a cob offering with turkey, bacon, and blue cheese, to the brunch burger loaded up with bacon, cheese and of course, a fried egg.

*Insiders tip* - All burgers are also available with grilled chicken in place of the burger! Not wanty the bun? Get it as a wrap! All burgers come with a side of tots and for a few bucks more you can upgrade to topped tots. 

Also - if you're a good customer you might be able to get the chef to whip you up kickass chicken nachos instead of the standard chicken ones. A couple bucks more but ooooh so good! Get them with a blue cheese drizzle to ease the burn.

My favorite new item, which I have yet to try but it earns special mention for sheer size, if the new not just a wedge salad. It is a whole head of lettuce (Screw you steak houses with your tiny wedges!) with bacon, egg, and oodles of blue cheese. I personally have never eaten a whole head of lettuce, but I see an attempt happening soon.

A side note on service as I've seen a couple people mentioning bad service. I am there a lot, usually perched at the end of the bar sipping lagers watching a game. I have never seen a waiter or bar staff member not go out of their way to make a pleasant experience for a guest who was NOT BEING AN ASS. Tomato on your salad? Of course. Extra dressing? Certainly. Blend your burger and serve it with a straw? Right away Governor, how are those beaches doing? 

That being said, if you're falling asleep drunk, yelling and snapping your fingers with your skanky assed friends while ordering some seven layer floated drink, you might see delayed service. Please don't take this personally and accost me at the bar. You'll only prove my point about you, and frankly I probably wasn't even talking about you, so your guilt over being a bad drunk is being mis-directed.

Specials vary during the week ($2 Tacos on Tuesday is one of my favorites) and there are nightly discounts on drinks as well. Happy hour is usually jumping! so get there early.",2012-12-07 18:00:53

For one thing, I didn't see a sign out front. Maybe there was one, but I didn't see it. Maybe they think they don't need a sign because it's right next door to the 12th Street gym.

The downstairs space is enormous with a bar and plenty of table seating. Even though the place was nearly empty, the service wasn't very good. But the server might have been new and that is why she forgot orders and took a long time in serving drinks. The menu looked good, but I think the presentation left something to be desired. The food was in generous portions, but didn't look appetizing. 

When I went upstairs to use the restroom and see the lounge, I gasped. It is this large, long empty space. The space is breathtaking with window views of 12th street. I ended up staying upstairs for a long time and was the only person there. I thought that Tabu has a treasure of a space and fantasized about what I'd do if I owned Tabu. The upstairs could be a fabulous dance spot. Or a performance space.  

The decor in the lounge was shabby with visible plaster on the floor. The furniture was modern, but looked cheap. With the economy, I understood that the owners were probably losing money and couldn't decorate. But they had scant decoration using dollar store paper lamp shades. 

Tabu is a diamond in the rough... I fear that the place will go under if it doesn't attract a clientele. Right now it's used as a spillover place for more popular gayborhood spots. They are trying to bringing people in with Quizzo and karaoke. We'll see how it goes.

Let me start off by saying that I went there for their weekly event, ""Sinful Sundays"" starring the Goddess Isis, which was in fact a FABULOUS drag queen show featuring seven different drag queens, all of whom put on dynamite performances!

And another amazing thing, it cost a measly $5 to get in, and the first drink is free! Plus, since it was happy hour, all my drinks were only $2! That's right, $2! I had three rum and cokes for $6, I have never paid so little to drink.

Plus, I really liked Tabu, it was clean, well-lit, nicely decorated, with great service, and really nice bathrooms. The stage room had lots of seating and all of the drag queens made sure that everyone was having a great time.

I would go back again in a heart beat!

Pros

-very cheap cover charge and first drink was free
-happy hour special was a great deal, $2 drinks!
-the drag queen show was AMAZING
-everyone was really friendly and wanted to have fun

Cons

-parking might be a serious issue but since I went Sunday night it was not a problem and after 10 pm it is free",2013-07-26 18:05:09

Okay, I knew walking in that it was a gay sports bar, not that it mattered to me.  Interestingly...or perhaps not...all but one of the TVs had the Big 10 wrestling tournament on with one lone TV set to soccer.  Lots of Penn State wrestling fans in the house?

My boyfriend and I were bar hopping and walked into this Tabu place we've never heard of. Downstairs was a small bar with a few people...we glanced at the weekly specials posted on a board and said, ""Hey this would be good on a weeknight..."". Yet nothing special so far. 

Then we turned up the tall narrow staircase that is so common to many bars in Philly to a different world. It was dark and neon-y and it was boppin! It was a different sort of dance floor that we laid eyes upon: no obvious grinding, not a lot of women, and Jurassic Park was playing on both sides of the wall. But that isn't to say that it wasn't fun! The Saturday night DJ was alternating between techno beats and some non-mainstream yet dance-able rhythms. And bless that air conditioning that other dance-floors lack.

We all paid $10 to go upstairs and the 2 mixed friends didn't even get a chance to order a drink.. not because they were crazy busy but, because the staff was negligent and extremely rude! 

1. One of them asks if a server (who was behind the bar) was a bartender (not knowing that he was a server) and all he said was ""oh no I don't make drinks""..He didn't even show her who the bartenders where. 
2. The mixed friend went to go order a round of drinks and a girl bartender with black hair standing right in front of her face ignored her. She waited until the bartender was done doing what she was doing and asked again, same thing. The bartender also stared at her and just laughed in her face. So, my friend spoke with the manager...he offered a complimentary drink but she said no. That's not the point. 
CUSTOMER SERVICE KEY. 
3. She went back upstairs to ask a different bartender for a drink he gets an attitude and says ""they're done"" (referring to my two mixed friends) and starts laughing with the same girl bartender about the situation. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.

Tabu definitely provides a more chill vibe where their different events let everyone feel like they have a seat. I've come here regularly enough to confidently say that I can't recommend anything food-wise from the menu except for the tots (who doesn't love tots!?). Most things taste overdone (burnt, dry, chewy, etc.) and processed cheese isn't my cup of tea. After the move to their new location, Tabu has changed a bit to their menu - most notably their lovable tots have gotten pricier, no new but fewer entree selections, drink daily specials now include both beer and cocktail specials, and daily food specials have changed. 

What keeps me coming back: Quizzo. My roommates and I come for weekly trivia because who doesn't like rounds of themed questions and a comedic host. While we don't always leave with a prize, some brain stimulation and laughs are always happy endings to hump day (Wednesdays).

My straight friends didn't have their behinds grabbed, AND they got to watch the game, so that's the equivalent of a thumbs up from them.

The music they play is just as all over the map as their clientele. It's the only place I can imagine hearing M83, Britney Spears, The Naked and Famous, and Bon Jovi in the same hour and not feel schizophrenic.

The food is good, the staff is approachable (not standoffish like certain other bars), and they serve moonshine, which I thought was illegal, but apparently isn't. And they donate part of what they make to the neighborhood if you care about that sort of thing.

We will be advising everyone we know to avoid your establishment in the future, not due to the behavior of your staff that led to the disservice, but due to the reactions of the managers and how the situation was (not) resolved. 4 of us entered the establishment and promptly two of us were served, we stood at the bar and sang along to the music videos that were playing on mute on the TV. The other two people in our group, did not get served. They asked someone behind the bar for a drink and he apparently was not a bartender. They asked the girl behind the bar for a drink and were ignored, then after a second request laughed at. I finished my drink and went out to smoke and found my two friends sitting outside, one in tears, after having been refused service and then been asked to leave by the bouncer. While we were outside, we saw some guy get bounced and yell and act belligerent. We called our Ubers and left. When my friend tried to report this whole incident to a manager, she got a snide, dismissive response. Some dolt manager here wrongly assumed that someone in our group groped someone and had to be removed. My friend felt that your employees refused her service because of the color of her skin because the two in our group who were served were Caucasian and the two who were refused service are PoC. The manager who responded to her emails actually called her a racist for self-describing as mixed when describing the situation. This is laughably terrible service and treatment, especially for a bar that has an \""anti-discrimination\"" policy publicly posted online. It\'s also absurd and ridiculous for whoever it was to assume that our group was in any way related to that random guy who apparently groped someone. It\'s offensive to be lumped into that category by people who clearly had no handle on the situation. I had a good time, until I found out how terribly my friends had been treated. Now I\'m disgusted by your establishment and staff.

I submitted that to their website for feedback and after 24 hours had no response, I then emailed it word for word to jeff beginning with 
""This email is in reference to the feedback I submitted on your website and still haven't gotten a response back. It seems to me like you don't care, because this is a fairly serious situation that warrants attention.""

Jeff Sotland (manager):""We are sorry you are offended.  We have replied to your friend and thought she would have communicated that response to you.  We will address your email internally.

Thank you.""

ME: ""Your response to her was so awful it prompted my response.""

Jeff: ""We are looking into the events. ""

Me:""When can I expect information on the outcome of your ""looking into the events""?""

Jeff:""This will be internal.  There will be no more information forthcoming. ""

Me: ""So you don't actually care and won't be addressing anything, great. The word will be spread about this, thank you for your time and the ounce of consideration you gave.""

Jeff: ""Quite to the contrary.  Our attorney will be investigating since legal action was threatened.  It appears from the first commmunication we received that there was an interest in deriding the establishment and little interest in our handling...so this is where our communication will end. ""

Not once did anyone threaten legal action, jeff. We said we'd take our story public. I really hope you talk to your lawyer and he can tell you it's a civil rights violation to deny service on the basis of someone's skin color. It's not slander or libel if we are recounting our actual experiences. and ""deriding"" isn't illegal, It's just making fun of something. in this case your incompetent handling.",2018-03-12 20:13:39

I went on my birthday last year and had an ok time based only on the fact that someone who sat next to me was a good conversationalist. The service seemed pretty terrible but I just let it slide.

I went a few nights ago with two friends, and after this I wouldn't come back for any reason.

I don't know what the bartender on the first floor's problem is, but it's time to retire. He's just a straight up asshole. I found out later from someone on a gay dating app that his name is Phil. Like, literally I had left and I told this guy I had just been there and he asked me to describe the bartender, and when I did he said ""Oh that's Phil. He's a mess.""

Anyway, I came in with two friends after a night of partying. One friend is a straight dude, he was in traditional Scottish garb including a kilt. Kilts are actually a fetish garment in the queer leather community so I don't see why this would be an issue. My other friend was a black woman. This Phil guy was immediately shady to us. I don't know if he doesn't like women, or black people, or what his fucking problem was, but he was being a total jackass from the start.

We ordered our round of drinks, and then I say to him, I say ""Can I have the wireless password?""

And he looks down his nose at me and he says ""Are you going to say please?"" And he wasn't being cute or playful. He was just being a dick.

So I said ""Uh, may I please have the wireless password?"" Which he gave to me, and then ignored us for the remainder of our visit.

We finished our round and then headed across the street to a straight Latino bar/restaurant called El Toro where we were treated SO MUCH BETTER. Seriously, I was wearing a floral cap that said ""QUEEN"" in gold stitching across it, and the tattooed Latino straight dudes were nicer to me. We spent over $200 at this other bar.

My friend was standing with others beside the stage to watch the drag show, when a bouncer decided he was drunk, grabbed him, and pushed him onto the street.

I called the police, who responded and took a report, but nothing will probably come of it.

We had heard that the Making Time party that we had tickets for was at a gay bar, but we thought nothing of it. Apparently this place is SERIOUS. To buy drinks on normal nights, you have to buy a membership. You have to be a member of a gay bar. 

The party itself was fantastic. I had heard that these parties attract a lot of people, but the spacious Pure was able to hold everyone, and not uncomfortably (though I did burn several people with my cigarette and spill some drank on others). One of my favorite aspects of the club was the upstairs cage-like area. My imagination went wild when it came to what would happen there on a regular night. It was straight out of Queer As Folk. On this particular night, there was intense trance in this slightly closed off space, and I was not ready for it. I moved to the balcony and puffed away, relishing the fact that I could smoke butts with the finest hep cats that Philly had to offer. 

Not only are there two levels, but there are are plenty of nooks to escape the crowd. Boothed areas off of the dance floor make it possible to have dance parties with a select group of friends. If it's intimacy that you are avoiding...well, good luck. It doesn't get any more intimate than the bathrooms, which are co-ed. One of the toilets is all urinals, save one stall which is generally being occupied by coke snortin' mofos. 

I had a really great time here, and I would not hesitate to return for a Making TIme extravaganza, but judging by the crowd that remained at 3:00 am, I don't think I could handle the shirtless orgy that occupied the dance floor. No siree.",2009-05-26 20:20:40

I'm sure that at times this place is fun. However, on the night I went, at least 4 people (including myself) had their wallets stolen out of purses and pockets, I am assuming while dancing. I first noticed my wallet was missing and went outside to begin calling my banks right away. My friend then checked her bag and noticed her stuff was missing too. While I was outside, at least two other people were saying the same thing happened to them. There happened to be police officers outside so we all took turns talking to them, although at that point there wasn't much they could do. Eventually the club closed while we were all still on our phones and as people were filing out, I really had to use the bathroom and wasn't sure how I was going to get home with no wallet, so I explained to the bouncers that the reason I stepped out was to use my phone because my wallet was stolen and could I please take a minute to use the bathroom. They refused. 

I know this was probably just bad luck - someone was clearly out on a mission to steal wallets that night. However, the atmosphere of the club was also just not that great. It was fun to dance with my friends but other people there were really aggressive. At one point a guy started dancing with me and grabbed my hand and licked my fingers. I kept having to tell people no and they didn't want to take no for an answer.

Non-members  pay a huge cover charge and be granted Guest Status for the evening.  Since it's a members-only club, guests can't buy their own drinks, so you have to suck up to a member (easily identifiable by their wristbands) and hand them cash who will hand it to the bartender on your behalf.  The sucking up is actually not bad-- the members are friendly and accommodating, and it's a nice way to talk to people.  

Yeah, the music was a bit too loud, but earplugs helped that.  And yeah, drinks were expensive (especially for a non-member who wound up buying a drink for the kind member/chap who ran beverage interference for mine), but you don't go to a club to save your pennies.   So shaddap and have a great time!

I will say this: The place was fairly empty before 2am, but at 2:15am after the other bars closed, it was wall-to-wall sweaty shirtless menz, which is not a bad thing.  There was still plenty of room on one of 87623876 dance floors.  

My favorite spot is the downstairs bar, which is run by the best bartender ever.  It's quieter, it's pink and fuzzy (like your mom), and they play a killer mix of 80s remixes... amazing.  And you can hear yourself think, which is a plus.

Depending on the event, the music is generally good. Sometimes it's definitely not my taste but I'm picky about what I wanna hear at a club. Bathrooms are unisex and dirty. You definitely want to hover while using the toilet or you will get pee on your butt. 

The club itself has a lot of space which is awesome, but some patrons are really rude. People on the dance floor can be careless as I've been burned by cigarettes...

A month or two ago my friends and I bought tickets to see Robyn at Voyeur.  Subsequently, a friend of mine, who was visiting from LA, wanted to get tickets a few weeks ago.  However, at that point, tickets were no longer being sold online, only at the door, which was totally fine with us.  

Now, the problem started when I called two days before the show and specifically told the person my friend was visiting me from out of town and asked when and what time we could purchase a ticket for her.  I was told we could purchase tickets when the door opens at 10pm.  To be safe, we got there at 9:30pm and waited in line.  It wasn't until 10:30-11pm that Voyeur starts telling everyone in line that the show was sold out when no one even purchased tickets at the door yet.  We asked how this could be since no one purchased tickets in line yet and we were told that they opened at 6pm to sell tickets and that's when it sold out.  Thanks to Voyeur, I had to sell my ticket because my friend from out of town could not get one.  

So, the moral of the story is that no one at Voyeur knows or, if they do know, cares to tell people when tickets at the door actually go on sale.  Get there early no matter what someone from Voyeur tells you.  Great policy!",2012-07-06 14:08:35

I wouldn't be compelled to write this review except for the fact that I have read similar accounts months back from strangers and have also heard stories from friends alike and something NEEDS to be done to stop this, whether by the police or the club owners/management. My wallet and my friends wallet were stolen at Voyeur roughly a month back...my friend's phone was also stolen. The reason I am certain of this is that our empty wallets (well besides useless cards and receipts) were later obtained from the club itself; however, all credit/debit cards and forms of ID were removed and the same purchases had been made on all of our credit cards. It was a very sketchy situation altogether. If I hadn't read the other reviews or spoken with friends and friends of friends who had similar incidents occur at this same establishment at various times, I would not be concerned and write it off as a petty criminal targeting girls who were not so observant after a couple drinks and trying to have a fun carefree night;  however, there is obviously a trend here. To clarify, I am not saying that Voyeur is directly involved, but the management's response to this was basically I'm so sorry this happened to you, it could happen anywhere and I always tell girls to be careful with their purses. I was very appreciative of the apology; however, in retrospect and with hearing all of these other similar stories I would've immediately said yes, this COULD happen anywhere but it happened HERE and has happened here multiple times so you have a responsibility to address it so that your guests feel safe enough to come again...after all it is a fun place with great music and atmosphere!

My friends and I were going to be attending a Making Time event and I was thinking I would be facing unfriendly bartenders and mingling amongst members who weren't thrilled about the guests coming in for special events.

Not true at all. The club was fun, the bartenders were pretty friendly (the one downstairs was a bit surly but the ones upstairs were super nice) and drinks weren't as bad as I expected once the free special ran out downstairs. I got a rum and coke for $6 and it was pretty strong... that price is kind of normal for a club anyway. I've had drinks the same size and price at Shampoo and other clubs and you can barely taste the alcohol. 

The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is because they wouldn't let us in on time. The event started at 9 and we were told we wouldn't be let in until 10:30... even though the free drink specials were only from 9-11. That was a bit annoying, but they went ahead and let us in around 9:45 I believe, so we still had plenty of drinking time. 

That being said, the Making Time event was Midnight Juggernauts and Die Antwoord, and MAN! What a show! the crowd was mainly hipsters, which I expected, but everyone was friendly, polite, and rocked out like maniacs. 

I'd totally see a show there again.

So its open late, like really late and people really do dance well here. Its just nice to see A LOT of people able to dance well rather than most people grinding and a few people dancing face to face and of that, only a third of them actually being able to dance well opposed to people who think they can dance because they are drunk.

The music is very good just for party mentality and the venue itself is very big and open on the main dance floor which l usually chill at. Go upstairs and look down at the dance floor and just the venue as a whole. It's nice to take it all in.

If you're homophobic or dont know the reputation of this place.... well its primarily a gay club. Unisex bathrooms and drag queens. If that bothers you, dont go here. Also sometimes people may mistake you for being gay since you are at a gay club after all and may put their arm around your waist(which is a bit much for me but l dont blame them since lm there). Just jokingly tell them 'haha lm sorry lm w the girls' and they're cool about it. However..... if they notice you're homophobic and uncomfortable, people will have fun w you lol. Short story, after one club, the girls we were w still wanted to dance and knew people so we'd get in free at Voyeur so we all went. One of my friends brought his buddy who was homophobic and was obviously uncomfortable there. Guys flirted w him obnoxiously hard as entertainment and one guy even walked up to him and kissed him on the cheek and he freaked out. l thought it was funny because he was making himself a target for being too obvious he was uncomfortable. 

Entertainment wise, this place is ridiculous. lm always entertained when l see a hardcore Drag Queen come out and go nuts. Its the same thing when Umpa Lumpa's and Stormtroopers are running around a club. Its just entertainment. 

Pretty much, if you feel like staying out late and dancing and you're not homophobic, you'll have a great time here. Oh yea the drinks are cheap which is a nice bonus.

Or if you've got boobs, just tell them you want to pay less. Why this works at a gay bar I have no idea. 

The main dance floor is usually playing house and is loud and full of people on ecstasy. They are entertaining as long as you don't mind being groped as you make your way to the bar for a drink. If you mind being groped under any circumstances you maybe shouldn't come here. There's a slightly quieter back bar on the main floor. Downstairs has kind of a loungey feel and is where you should take your too-drunk-also-crying friends to calm him down. Also if you lose someone and can't find them anywhere they are probably making out with someone on a barstool down here. Upstairs the line at the bar is usually shorter, and along the sides you can watch the main dance floor from above. The entertainment value is high.

its NOT a gay club, just because it is in the gayborhood and the majority is a gay crowd, that does not mean it is a gay club....it is an AFTERHOURS CLUB.

for the whole rant Andrew T. went on about...NO ONE wants your ""gay"" club. MAKING TIME parties are thrown FOR ALL, not just for ""hipsters"" and indie kids. Its an afterhours club, and a great venue to have a party #1, so WHY not dance there? The BEST times @ Pure are the MAKING TIME parties anyways.

There are three floors. The lowest level is a karaoke joint until 12am. There is a bit of a dance floor but the majority of the space is taken up by a huge bar. Every time I've gone, this floor has been pretty packed. 

The main level is top 40 / house. Whereas I generally enjoy this type of music, I've never really stayed on this floor too long. The mixes are always repetitive and drawn out. That's my own taste, though. It's just a bit light for me.

The top floor is urban and hip hop, much smaller, sweaty and, in my opinion, the most fun. The setup is a bit more low key than the main level, you can see the DJ on his Macbook, but it's dark and loud and everything a nightclub should be. 

Again, this club does not get busy until others start closing down. If you go early, the cover is $2 - $5. If you get there after 11 I think, it's $10 - $15. I don't drink but I've heard the drinks are a bit expensive. All in all, I've always had a good time.",2012-02-24 00:36:13

So let me start by saying that if you are looking up Voyeur on Yelp, you have probably never been there and are trying to decide whether to go or not. Let me help you with that decision, based on my own experiences of this club. 

The first time I was here I was 17. I flashed my shitty fake ID to the bouncer who didn't even pretend to check it because he was too distracted by my (hot, 20 year old, white, male) neighbor and his two look-alike friends. We had a few over-priced drinks and overall a relatively average evening. 

Cut to 2014. Three years after my first visit. 

I'm twenty years old. I'm young, I'm white, I'm hot.... but I'm also female. Going to a club as an underage person is technically illegal and my friends and I all understood the risks implied in our actions when we attempted to enter this date-rape dungeon. However, I want to share this story because even if it only prevents one young man from being harmed, I think its worth it.  

My friend Johnny and I came here to support our good (also underage) in a drag competition. We both are using fake IDs purchased from the same person, because we are still a few months away from 21. Johnny shows his ID to the cartoonish-ly gigantic bouncer who eyes it suspiciously but eventually chuckles-- anyone can see that my boy Johnny is incredibly attractive-- so he shakes his head and allows him to pass through. Then the bouncer takes one look at my ID, smirks at me, and says ""This is fake. It's mine now. Bye."" We were detrimentally confused, but didn't want to make a scene so we walked away. 

When we walked away, I was more upset that this man snatched my card away from me than I was upset that he tried to exclude me from my friend's show. Johnny walked back to the ""bouncer"" by himself to ask, ""Can I get my friend's ID back please?"" The guy responds and says, ""Sure, for $40"". Really. He said that. This man did not even wait to be prompted with an offer of bribery-- he asked for the bribe himself. 

Sadly this club stays open later than all the other places in the neighborhood, so it will not be shut down anytime soon out of pure necessity. I just hope that no one (especially the cute young boys they let in) is severely hurt while Voyeur Nightclub is still open.",2014-06-27 05:54:15

The area consists of a large dance floor with leather chairs on one side and two bars against the other wall. I didn't like paying $6 for a bottle of Miller Lite...are you kidding? However, the bartender said something about not even being able to buy alcohol if you are not a member (not to self: join?). We sat down for a little bit, it was pretty empty. However, my friend said since this place is open til 4am it would start to get packed real soon. He was right. At around 2:15am, it looked like a night club- awesome techno/club music (tiesto, lady gaga remixes, etc), shirtless gay dudes grinding on each other and the girls they are with, people smoking cigarettes and other things I'm sure.

* ineffective security:  my camera, which i had just gotten and was being pretty careful about, was stolen when i was there, and i was one of at least four people to whom this happened! BE CAREFUL!
* the bar setup is not conducive to efficient service when crowded
* unnecessary sass from bartenders
* they charge you for water

more details:

* stolen camera:  before you think i was just a sloppy, irresponsible mess, please note:  (a) i was debuting my new camera that night and was being pretty careful about either keeping it on my wrist or putting it in my purse and (b) i was one of at least FOUR people who had either a camera, cell phone and / or purse stolen that night... coincidence?  doubtful.  pure has an elaborate security setup, but it's clearly ineffective, and it is my civic duty to give a one-star review to a place that cannot offer a secure environment for its patrons

""  when the place is crazy crowded, the bars are understaffed and not physically setup in a strategic manner that allows for more free-flowing libations

""  having worked in service before, i sympathize with bartenders dealing with needy, obnoxious patrons, BUT that does not warrant a bartender yelling back at someone (not me, FYI) upset about not being served ""Get over it!  You're not being served right now, get over it, you asshole!""

*  i asked for water or a club soda to hydrate, and they opened a bottle of generic spring water and asked for $5... FYI, miller lights are $6, so if you splurge $1, you'll practically get water with a little kick

I've only been to Voyeur (and before that, Pure) for Making Time a bunch of times since '09. I only go when I'm a big fan of the musicians performing, and I have seen some greats here. Some bands are just cut out for a nice late night club, and it ALWAYS delivers. I do miss when Simian Mobile Disco so frequently visited. I have also considered Voyeur for their Thursday weekly, Snacks. Someday soon.

St. James Street, or the ""alley"" down which Voyeur is located, is not sketchy. It's a cobblestone half-street in Center City Philadelphia.

I have always had a great time here. I'm a big fan of the downstairs bartender, too, by the way! Or the downstairs in general, which is why I should really go to Snacks.

The main floor is typically packed, sometimes it gets so full that you aren't even in charge of your own dance moves anymore - and you feel more like a pinball in an arcade game. But it's all good..because you will have fun. You will drink free PBR until 11. You might eat a bunch of free hotdogs. And you might wait in some lines to use the coed bathrooms, but that will be okay too, because the people in line are usually fun. You might even get your picture taken. Sometimes in the bathroom. But it's cool, because party pics are cool.

If you like to have a more relaxed or intimate time with a good view, go upstairs to the balcony. That's my spot. I just gave away my spot. You can even sit down. And, you can see the disco ball from here.",2012-04-22 18:30:22

Tip: You are allowed to smoke in this club -- so expect leaving smelling of smoke --your hair, your jeans, your clothes, everything -- you're gonna have that heavy smoke smell when you leave. 

$4 tecantes and I think $10 red bull vodkas (not 100%) sure, but I think the $4 tecantes are reasonable .. it's not a great beer, but it'sa reasonable price for the area

The venue itself is nothing special -- but also nothing wrong with it either. I do like that there is a bottom floor and bar, but you can also go upstairs to hangout, people watch / band watch and relax. I believe there was another room upstairs, as well as downstairs as well for side-room/Djs which is fun.

Ooh another tip: bathroom -- unisex. 2 urinals in the same room as the 2 stalls you can wait for, so don't be surprised!

So, I knew what to expect, or so I thought.  The dinner place was good (as you'll see in another review), but we didn't stay there all night...

Enter, Voyeur Night Club.

Andy insisted it was awesome, and who am I to argue with a freshly-turned 30-yr old gay man intent on having a good ole' time on his special day?  Apparently this is a gay bar (sometimes?), but that's not the vibe I got as I walked in the door. It reminded me of the old days at Polly Esther's on Race St, only lacking the 70s & 80s rooms, and therefore nowhere near as cool (anyone remember)?  Why did it close?!?!?

Anyway...I haven't been to a place like this in quite a few years, and I immediately knew why. It was crazy packed, loud, smoky, and very colorful (take that however you will).  It's not like I had a bad time or anything...it was kinda fun for a change...but I just kept wondering what the heck I was doing there. It just wasn't me; not sure it ever was.  For an early-20's guy looking to mingle with a sea of drunk women...it is THE place to go. You could almost hear the fizzle of the rufies dissolving in girl's drinks. So, while I have nothing against bars in the Gayborhood, I don't think I'll ever return to this place. But heck, if they can still charge a $15 dollar cover and pack the place like that, more power to 'em!",2011-08-14 22:35:37

Voyeur is no Output (Bklyn) or Space (Miami) and the closing time (3:20 am)  is laughable for an ""after hours""; but it is an oasis of club/alternative culture in a city which is sorely lacking in options.  The one benefit of a club like Voyeur in a city of limited options is that the lack of alternatives leads like-minded souls to mingle regardless of sexuality, style or agenda.  I do not make it to Voyeur much but when I do I am always struck and inspired by the easy mixing of cultures. This is what the great clubs the world-over used to be like before the advent of bottle service and fear-based closed-mindedness.  I notice a coupe of negative comments on security on here, but I have to say I have never had an issue with the gents in black. It is extraordinarily difficult for clubs like Voyeur to keep going in the current political climate, so if security is a tad stern that is perhaps a small price to pay for admission to an oasis as unique as this.",2017-05-15 05:55:12

Oh -- sorry, I didn't mean to accidentally refer to this ""private, after-hours club"" as a nightclub.

So, what's the difference between Voyeur and a regular nightclub, other than the fact that Voyeur is open 'til 4am, permits smoking inside, and is really freaking big?

Without further ado, here's a list of what makes Voyeur special (and I mean shortbus-special, not special-special):

-- Cover was $25.  I told the doorman that I was on the guestlist.  He said there was no guestlist.  I made up some sh*t about the guestlist being ""on Facebook"".  He shrugged.  Suddenly the cover was $10.

-- Coat check was $2.  The bimbo working there spilled her drink on my coat.  I didn't tip.  She called me a jackass.  (Yeah, she drinks on the job and ruins my threads, yet *I'm* the jackass.)

-- I saw vajayjay.  I'm talkin' 16-year-old vajayjay with a fake ID and a serious FUPA problem.  Multiple times over.  What has been seen cannot be unseen.

-- There was puke on the floor on at least two occasions.

-- There was a fight in the alley as I was leaving.  Seeing this was the most fun part of the Voyeur experience, I think.   Blood on ice....wooooooooooo.  Sometimes I lie awake at night wondering if the police ever arrived.

Good, creative restaurants? Absolutely. Anywhere where I can get excellent customer service and a good story to take with me? Sign me up. But nightclubs? Just not my thing.

But on that note, Pure is a good example of what so many dancey clubs try hard to be. It's big (three floors). There are lots of bars. The music is loud. There is a coat check. And the big booths on the main dance floor offer optimum people watching space. But they also do a bunch of things that didn't make me feel so thrilled, either.

Drinks are EXPENSIVE. Crazy expensive. It wasn't that crowded (even though I was there on a Saturday night until after 1'ish, although I know they also do after-hours, so maybe it was too early, just not for me).

They did not even have Neospora. The manager did not help her and said he had other things to do. This makes no sense because they can be sued and it is a general liability case. What was worse that they can be sued for Punitive Damages, the girl that fell, the staff tricked and saw she was not paying attention to her phone and stole the phone. She later was looking for it and the phone could not be found. She went outside to look for it and they did not let her in because they claimed she was drunk, which she was not (how did they come into the determination that she was drunk), but the real reason was that she said she would file a lawsuit that they did not have any medication for someone that gets hurt on the premises, and they left her outside without a phone and without a jacket in the cold, without her wallet. So if she was drunk, how responsible are they to leave a drunk person outside without a jacket, phone and her wallet (ID)? Don't they have to pay for this? If one of us had not followed her we had no idea where to find her and they did not allow her to get her stuff or contact her friends. I want the owner to contact me before we go any further. This is a very serious matter. The girl does not speak English well and I think the staff thinks that they were going to get away with it. At the very end, they gave her the phone outside and they had stolen it and had the phone the whole time. This is not acceptable. This is not only a matter of filing a lawsuit for compensatory damages but they deserve to pay punitive damages for having a manager and staff without any training and for having such a large club with hundreds of people without the basic first aid kit.

I'll start by saying this is the only ""club"" in Philadelphia that I enjoy visiting.

Voyeur Nightclub is a gay club that features three different floors, each with it's own unique vibe. To get in, you'll pay an expensive cover that increases each hour. The most I've had to pay is $30. Once you're inside, drinks are also expensive. Some bartenders will laugh in your face if you ask for a cup of water, others will hand you a bottle and not charge you.

The music is consistently on point, the lights are so much fun, and the confetti that falls later in the evening is a great touch. The overall experience is worth the cover charge and expensive drinks, but I write this as someone that stops by on a once or twice per month basis. If I were to come to Voyeur every weekend, I'd be broke and exhausted.

The bouncers can be rude, they might also hit on you. Each stop along the way at this club is a hit or miss customer service experience. Just know that once you're inside, you will be provided with everything you need to have the time of your life.",2021-09-19 14:19:01

I love that there are 3 floors with different music- depending on your mood you can choose a room and still have fun. 

Now the trouble. The last time I was there, it was Friday and not crazy busy, but a decent sized crowd. I had a bit to drink, but I wasn't very drunk. I could still walk, function and all just fine. My friends and I went down to the bottom floor to use the bathroom and while going down, one of the bouncers took my arm and escorted me out. I didn't understand what was going on until we got outside and he said I had to leave. What?! He said I was stumbling on the stairs and too drunk to stay. Like dude, I have on 4 inch heels, your stairs are uneven, it's dark and I'm not 100% sober, of course I'm going to teeter. But, he didn't care. I told him my friends and my stuff were still inside and he told me to call them and tell them to meet me outside. Their signal in there isn't the greatest and my calls kept going to voicemail and my messages were waiting to send. It's winter, the middle of the night, and while there are people around- including a few bouncers- I'm still a young woman alone. I'm crying when my friends come out and a manager walks up asking what happened. I told him and he kindly apologized for the situation and told us we could go back in if we wanted.

Overall this place was super great. I read the reviews before going and felt like it was pretty descent. You have to be 21 to enter. Me and my friends got there a little past 12am, and the charge was $20 on a Saturday night (the only reason I didn't give 5 stars, that's a lil on the expensive side lol). I don't know if that's because of the time we went at tho?? The venue wasn't too crowded at that time. It got more busy around 1am, it was pretty cramped in the hip hop floor. They turned on the lights at 3:20am and started to guide people out the door. 

Music:
They have 3 floors of music. The basement was kind of just random music, like I didn't get a sense as to a specific genre. The main floor is EDM which looked like the busiest and was the biggest floor. The top floor is hip-hop music, the space wasn't too big tho. I spent 90% of my time there and the DJ played a good mix of current music and throwbacks. 

Gayborhood:
Some reviews on here said there wasn't many queer people, but there was quite a lot of queer people while I was there, especially black queer men. I'd say it's a good mix or queer and hetero folxs.

Age:
Me and my friends are only 21 and it seemed like the atmosphere was more of a late 20s and up age range. That wouldn't stop me from going tho.

I had actually never heard of it but felt the recommendation was trust-worthy so we went.  The bouncer was kind of over the top.  ""You know your ID is expired, right?"" he said.  ""You know that doesn't change the fact that I'm clearly 28, right?"" I replied.  He let me in but for such a tiny little bar it was a lot of unnecessary hoopla.

I was really confused because our friend had mentioned Woody's in reference to Rosewood and then when we went in there I saw drink specials for Woody's.  I was very confused.  There was a small dance floor (I'll return to the dancing momentarily) but in the distance I saw a sign that said ""Dance floor upstairs.""  Since the dancefloor downstairs was so small we grabbed our drinks and started heading upstairs.  All of a sudden I looked around and we were IN Woody's!  It was a total mindf*ck.  I felt like we passed into an alternate reality.  I had no idea that Woody's was connected to another bar.  It was a $10 cover to go to the upstairs dance floor so we opted to stay at Rosewood.  Drinks were overpriced which was disappointing and they didn't sell any ciders, which is what I really wanted.  The crowd was mostly female with a guy here or there.  The vibe was decently friendly.  Some of the girls let my male coworker dance with their group which was cute.

The dance floor is a weird set up because it doesn't really exist.  People just gather to dance in a rather compact walkway near the DJ booth.  I usually like to be able to get up on something like a stage or a speaker when Beyonce came on, but there was nothing of the sort.  In fact we were kind of smooshed in by a bunch of security guys in a corner.  I will say that the music was quite good.  A lot of throwback '90s hip hop and R&B like Mariah Carey and Salt N Pepa.

While still clearly being chicken tenders, they were light and the honey mustard dipping sauce was excellent!

After sadly finding out that they had run out of filet medallions, I settled on the braised short rib (since the waiter suggested it and said it was their most popular item) and my GF had the BBQ chicken flat bread.  The food came out quite promptly and man, I was not disappointed in the short rib.  The chili powder sauce, while giving the meat a bit of kick, was not overpowering and the meat simply melted in your mouth.  The mashed potatoes that came with it were also excellent.

Our waiter was attentive without being overly present.  Cocktails were tasty and ice cold.  The asparagus fries are crispy with a hint of tang from the horseradish aioli.  We had a caprese salad that was on special, featuring local tomatoes that were ripe and juicy; and the steak and macaroni and cheese, which, on our server's suggestion, we went light on the blue cheese (which was a great tip on his part).

We rarely order dessert, but since we'd had a fairly light dinner, we thought we'd at least check it out.  An old school dessert tray arrived at our table, which was hilarious, though it was only stocked with cakes.  My feeling on cake is that it's only a vehicle for frosting.  So we opted for the cucumber lemon sorbet, which turned out to be more like an italian ice (the texture was extremely hard and crystallized), but tasty nonetheless.

I have never eaten food here, so my rating only applies to the bar, which in my opinion is awesome if you like strong, large drinks for a good price, oh, and you like older gay guys. 

I am a not young/not old  lesbian. So, I am quite often the only female in the bar, which is fine by me. The bartenders are super sweet, the martinis come in martini glasses from IKEA - which if you have seen these things - you know are enormous. 

Two drinks at Knock is like having 4-5 at any other establishment. It's a total bargain.

The bar is ""classy"" looking. The bathrooms are almost always totally clean - and the sinks glow red!

Least favorite thing about Knock: very crowded on any given night past 6pm and the bar tables are ""reserved"" LAME. It should be first come first serve. But this is a very minor complaint, and having to stand hasn't stopped me from frequenting this watering hole many times.",2012-03-10 03:49:55

Pluses of Knock:
- Not at all divy or seedy - Knock is clean, bar is well stocked and the clientele is definitely upscale
- Not overbearing - I've been in gay bars before where you can't order a drink without getting picked up.  This isn't the case here, although if you are looking for a quick hook-up, that's pretty easy here as well.
- Pleasant staff - nice guys (and they are all guys, in keeping with the theme here) who will joke with you and pay attention to detail
- Strong drinks - not shy about pouring the booze

Minuses:
- The food is definitely mediocre, at best.  While it isn't that pricey really and they clearly attempt to make it a little more upscale, the kitchen execution is pretty lousy.  Asked for a burger medium, got it beyond well done and an hour after I ordered it.  Calamari was rubber.

The food here is quite good, the drinks are classy and strong, and the outdoor seating wins on a sunny afternoon. Just prepare yourself for the ambulance sirens and the cars careening down this busy street.

Owned by Woody (the prior owner of the dimished namesake gay bar Woody's), this bar-slash-restaurant pleasantly kicks it up a notch with an appealing (if constantly crowded) interior, an oblong rich wooden bar reminiscent of Cheers, and a dining area extending through to the back of the space.  

What's memorable about this invention is that it 1) picks up the neighborhood by making good use of a space which has housed many failed restaurants; and 2) blends in with the revitilization of the 12th and 13th Street corridors that compose Philadelphia's LGBT neighborhood.  The bartenders shine, and they are more than pleasant, accomodating and deserving of their tips (albeit very busy during happy hour).  The drinks (as previously mentioned in another review) pack a whallop.  I had four rum and cokes (purchased by various friends during my time there) and consumption induced a comatose-like sleep later that night.

There is a fly in the ointment, however: the food.  For such a fine interior, the food (pork shank, lobster and pasta in a cream sauce) were memorable only in that the dishes were horridly bland.  I would sooner seek flavor by running my tongue along a carpet in an inner-city needle exchange clinic.  The upside: the waiter was pleasant.

Final thoughts: Great for drinks, company, and atmosphere.  Leave it at that and everyone will have a wonderful time.  Three stars for the business, an additional star for the pleasant staff.",2011-05-04 01:24:48

It mainly attracts an older crowd compared to Bump or Tavern, and most people are there for drinks. I'm no exception, having been there a handful of times for drinks, but finally went for dinner with a couple others earlier this week for the first, and last, time.

The service was fine, especially given that it was our waiter's first night. He was attentive and new the menu fairly well given that he was new. The host was also very pleasant and helpful. The food, on the other hand, was extremely disappointing for a center city restaurant.

I started with an arugula salad with a 'sweet citrus vinaigrette'. At first I thought they forgot the vinaigrette because I couldn't taste anything, even though I could see what looked like dressing on it, so I asked for some more. I was clearly mistaken, as the side cup they brought out was very lackluster. It tasted like extra virgin olive oil, ground pepper, and a very light hint of lime juice. No acid whatsoever, quite odd for a 'citrus vinaigrette'. The arugula also wasn't stemmed, and every bite I took ended with me covering my mouth to get the last couple of inches of stem in.

For my entree, I had a lobster-brie flatbread(aka pizza), and tasted pretty blah. The crust had more of a naan taste than 'flatbread' or pizza, and the topping of lobster-brie had no seasonings whatsoever. It felt like it would make for a nice party hors-d'oeurves, naan with a lobster-brie dip, but I didn't think it made for a good dish.

All in all, the restaurant is very so-so, especially given the prices. While I didn't have a full-priced $25-$30 entree, my friend did and was not pleased. I'm sure I'll be coming back for the bar, but the restaurant left me feeling bummed.",2009-04-18 15:37:09

Both of our entrees were otherworldly. The fig and syrah reduction used on my lamb lollipops was complex and soothing. The amount of food was spectacular and I couldn't finish everything on my plate. We did splurge for dessert... I had the best chocolate mousse of my life and D had the densest cheesecake known to man!

Toasty cedar smells always greet you when you walk in, the dark wood walls and faux-fireplace are highlighted by warm lights and a few tasteful mirrors.  This isn't your mother's gay bar.

Knock is so comfortable and friendly its no wonder that you see the same faces here day after day.  And unlike some other places in the vicinity, its always full of friendly conversation, a competent staff and very few roofies (kidding)... 

There was a time when I sat at the bar at Knock 2 or 3 times a week.  It's my Cheers.  I don't have time for those shenanigans anymore, but whenever I go back, I always drag friends along because you'll never find a more friendly bar.

Food: Ahi tuna appetizer was a hit.

They were out of lobster flatbread (due to a menu change) so we went with Sausage. It was warm. But between the crust and cheese, it had the consistency of frozen pizza. The sausage was good, though.

Chicken Piccata was OK. Based on the ingredients, they could have used either a bowl or a plate. They chose the latter and the sauce, while delicious, settled to the bottom of the plate, out of reach of the chicken and pasta. It was actually better the next day as leftovers once it congealed. 

Stuffed Chicken Breast was excellent. Tasty great combination.

Dessert: We had key lime pie and Italian cream cake. Both were delicious.

The first experience was last fall, when I was visiting Philly. I walked in just for drinks and was surrounded by friendly, smart, accomplished men who wanted to chat and enjoy life! Nothing wrong with that.

I was recently in Phily for a couple days and went to have dinner there on the first night. Lovely cocktail, amazing caesar salad, good crab cake, nice wine, attentive service. Great!

So great that I went the second night--and something had changed. The caesar salad wasn't as good, the service was harried and rushed. I actually wondered if I had forgotten to tip the night before, but when I looked at my bill, I saw that a tip had been given. So I don't know what happened--maybe they were just overworked that evening. But anyway, it dropped them from a 4 to a 3.",2010-01-03 17:33:32

The menu is fantastic, and the crowd is generally more polite, well-dressed, and professional than many other locales in the neighborhood.  Now, this is a double edged sword:  while it invites great conversation and gentlemen of similar backgrounds, it can also invite a mild snootiness and atmosphere ill-matched to a friendly neighborhood bar.  Then again, Knock isn't that corner taproom or neighborhood watering hole.  Instead, it's a good attempt at an upscale gay establishment.

I would rate Knock higher than three stars were it not for a few factors.  First, while the menu is fantastic and, frankly, delicious, the prices are higher than they should be.  While I understand the difficulty in making a restaurant inside a bar profitable, with some creative tweaking, the menu could change and prices could go down all the while keeping it delectable.  In addition, the overall layout of the bar itself is awkward.  Instead of having a traditional wall bar or rectangular bar with good lines of sight, the bar is, more or less, a right triangle with odd vantage points.  Finally, I'd say that the bar is entirely too small.  I have attempted to take dates here to have to leave because of the scores of men crammed into a tiny space all the while empty tables sit in the dining area.

I arrived first and our waiter who was also the bartender invited me to sit at the table of my choice. There was a party of four men and another of two women so I chose a table with a banquet. Our waiter came over gave me a menu, asked if I wanted a drink which I declined. He left and returned with two glasses of water. I looked over the special Restaurant Week menu and my friend arrived about 10 minutes later, after the we greeted each other, the waiter returned to our table and when we asked for some time to decide what we wanted, he said no problem, and gestured around the room to indicate how empty it was. When he returned we made our selection of salad, I had a turkey club which came with a small salad on the side, and a chocolate torte. My friend ordered the salmon burger which came with a side order of fries, and for dessert, a slice of carrot cake. Sandwiches, salads and fries were made to order and were excellent with thick slices of chicken breast on an excellent toasted bread. I asked that the cheese and bacon be left off my sandwich and was easily accommodated. The torte was a dense rich chocolate that was beyond delicious, and my friend was quite pleased with his carrot cake.  Afterwards he ordered coffee and I had tea and when our waiter brought out a very large teapot and set it down near me I fell in love with Woody. I'm a dedicated tea drinker, and seriously resent that tea is usually treated as an after thought in far to many restaurants, while coffee drinkers enjoy bottomless cups of coffee. Sometimes they insult tea buy throwing a cup of water in their microwave and bring it to the table with white foam floating on the water. All in all it was a lovely meal, waiter was friendly without hovering, and the ambience pleasant, with music from a streaming service.

Hubs and I did an impromptu visit to The City of Brotherly Love last Sunday. We walked here, there, and everywhere (covering *7* miles!) and worked up a bodacious appetite, figuring a nice meal at Knock is in order. We'll ignore the fact that this outing also served as our 15th anniversary dinner (go us!).

We've been here a few times before, but it *has* been quite a number of years since our last visit, so this was a highly anticipated experience (after all, we walked 7 miles you know!!).

Of course you're interested more in the place itself, so without further ado, let's get down to business. (Oh...hey Jonathan!!)

Service is impeccable. No complaints whatsoever. Our server was a lovely guy...very polite and accommodating. The meal itself was well-paced; we didn't experience long wait times between salads and the entrees, nor did the entrees come out while chowing down on the salads...so props there. Everyone we came into contact with was professional as you would expect in a higher-end restaurant.

Food: Very good. Just as good as I remember it years back.

Drinks: The two Kahlua and Baileys were even better! (hiccup!) Your host was feeling pretty good :)

Other: there is a bar area where friends can meet up and enjoy drinks and bar snacks, and there are TV monitors in that area. The dining area is a bit quieter and more intimate. Window seating is available but that typically depends on how busy it is. One thing darlings, is if you're planning to dine here on holidays (like Valentine's Day), a reservation is highly recommended.

So there you have it. We definitely look forward to a return.

Ciao...TTFN!

So, let's flash forward to our actual meal.  Our passable dinner came and went. There was a raucous memorial going on for some deceased drag queen (or similar local character), which only added to the ambiance...insert obvious sarcasm.

When our ""dining"" experience ended, I expected our server to bring the cake that I had arranged for that afternoon.  Instead he simply brought me the bill.  I could have said something at that point, but my friend would have been upset, so I let the moment pass.

They're really friendly, though.  When I sat down at the bar for dinner and a few post-convention libations, I was immediately welcomed into the inner circle of regulars -- my status as an out-of-towner be damned.  (Maybe that's how they treat all the ""fresh meat""?  I wouldn't know.)

Either way, I had a blast here.  The interior was sleek and classy, the bartenders were oh so sweet and friendly, and they pour a mean gin and soda.

The surprising part was the extensive and mouthwatering menu.  I was immediately drawn to the flatbreads (the locals said that those are most popular), but I opted for a calorie-conscious dinner and ordered a salad with grilled chicken.

Little did I know that my calorie-consciousness was for naught, since the salad was the size of a frickin' bathtub and had enough chicken on it to feed about seven of me.  There were also generous helpings of dried cherries and a sea of bleu cheese.  (The chef might've been a little heavy-handed with the bleu cheese, since the salad ended up a bit salty for my taste.)

Luckily, I was surrounded by a bunch of hungry barflies who were more than happy to eat my leftovers.  (Good thing they're not germophobes.)

All in all, dinner at Knock was a success, and I can't wait to ""knock"" on its lovely doors again...",2010-12-22 16:13:40

The seafood Alfredo consists of scallops, cod fish, and shrimp. I asked could the pasta only be shrimp and the restaurant was able to accommodate that. I was very impressed with my waitperson's follow-up to ensure that I got what I wanted. Unfortunately, the Alfredo sauce was watery and the shrimp seemed boiled.

You can just feel how classy it is once you come through the door. You have your choice to sit and mingle in the bar area, or grab a table in the fine dining area. This place is always rockin' each evening and through the weekend.

The bar area is spacious, and you have some of the best staff in Philly. Vinny, Jason, etc. are always so friendly and attentive the moment you step up; you almost feel like you've known them for years. It's kinda like a more-quiet sports bar, with tvs to catch games or evens on, but not loud so you can keep conversations going. Of course you can also order food to eat while you are at the bar or one of it's small side tables.

The fine dining area is really classy - white tablecloths, candlelight, nice plates and silverware - and it spans the long length of Knock. It's a gorgeous experience that rivals any of Philly's top restaurants. And the food is super-delicious; most notable are the burgers and the steaks. Knock usually has some unique veggie items to compliment the meal, such as asparagus fries.

You don't have to be gay to come here, and you won't feel uncomfortable here if you aren't gay.

Ohh KnOcK, where to even begin....It's restaurant week= a given 'hit or miss' experience! Tonight does NOT even come close to what is acceptable in my opinion. I just left 10 minutes ago, and had to start my review at ONCE, as it was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, and I eat ALOT!!

Lured by the tempting menu, my friend and I decided to stop in, to sample the fare. We were early for our 5:30pm reservation, so we grabbed a glass of vino at the bar. After couple of sips, the host led us to our table. Our eagerness for great food and light-hearted conversation were quickly turned into a surreal and upsetting evening.
Most people would agree, that I am a pretty well rounded, well traveled an open minded individual, rarely in my 33 years of life have I ever felt more uncomfortable than I was tonight.  Although, we observed that we were the only women in the restaurant, never did we feel intimidated or out of place. However, our icy server really made us feel unwelcomed tonight.
Our bus boy poured our water and informed us that 'Philip' will be by to take our order. Philip skipped the formalities and sauntered over to take our order. We started with the Heirloom tomato salad, he later plopped two pieces of hard sourdough rolls on our bread plates with some sort of whipped butter  (I couldn't be sure, as he turned on his heel and disappeared before we could ask what it was)  After a few minutes, he reappeared with our starter course, at first glance I could tell the tomatoes were not fresh, reaffirmed when my fork pierced into it, against my better judgment, I took a little taste, Blech!! I glanced at my friend's plate and saw the same lifeless appetizer staring back. As Philip coolly floated by our table, we debated whether to send the food back, we didn't want to be 'THOSE PEOPLE'  but this is simply unacceptable! He didn't seem to care that neither of us touched our plate and stopped eating all together. We finally decided to flag him down and informed him that the tomatoes were a little suspect to us and asked for new slices. He quickly swept up the plates and asked us if we wanted to get something else because 'We obviously find something wrong with the tomatoes'  Wait for it....EYE ROLL?! Really?! Not only did he express his disdain, that we pointed out that the food was subpar and inedible, but apparently we were really getting on his nerves now too!! GULP, we were the first reservation of the night, and he's already in a huffy mood, what will the night bring?!  Back to the kitchen he went, and out came our wedge salad, drenched in blue cheese dressing, which actually wasn't half bad, however the host soon brushed past our table and cooed to Philip 'let's scale back on those portions'. I was shocked at how rude and unprofessional the staff seemed to be!
Onto the battered asparagus fries, crispy on the outside and soggy on the inside, however the flavor was nice and the aioli sauce was a nice compliment. My friend's fried mozzarella was very bland, but the pesto and marinara sauce was tasty. The crab cake entree was rather luke warm and salty, it was a bit soggy and could have been cooked a little longer, but the portion size was nice. The dessert was nothing to write home about, pretty to look at, but just meh and was sitting in the fridge a tad too long.
My empty glass of Pinot sadly sat barren the whole night, I contemplated asking for  a refill, but I didn't know I could handle another awkward exchange and bagged the whole idea.

As the night wore on, a nice mix of people came in, Philip seemed to be a little less bent on being rude to us or we were just so immune to it that we didn't really care as much.

I can normally balance out the rating with the food to service ratio, however, tonight was unbelievably disappointing in every way!  I have been back to a couple of restaurants from visiting them at RW, but I could not bring myself even for a redemption drink, obviously Knock doesn't care so much, as they took my $35 and sent me on my way, lesson learned, however I take my Elite 12' status seriously, so here's another two cents (bad joke, I know)

RW is suppose to 'highlight' a restaurant's potential, but dear KNOCK, please consider taking your name off the participating restaurant list, if you feel that being part of RW is a hassle and not profitable enough that tonight was the kind of food and service that was presented, it's a disservice to the industry!

Sorry Yelpers, I have to SERIOUSLY disagree with the glowing reviews here, is it possible that we were at the wrong restaurant?!  This place is anything but, hospitable!!  Maybe if I stick to the liquid diet + karaoke, I wouldn't have been so twisted.

This past Sunday my boyfriend and I gather all our friends for a brunch before the equality forum.  There was 13 of us, and being in the restaurant business I know about big parties and the trouble they some times can be.  I will also mention that more that 80% of our party are also in the the restaurant biz.  Of course getting all 13 people together on time is an impossible feat.  We made the reso for 11:30 and knew that people would be late.  My boyfriend and I showed up at 11:50, yes we were late and felt very bad for being late and understood if we had to wait long for our table.  When we arrived 6 out of the 13 of our friends were at the bar.  My boyfriend went to the host, Jim, to tell him that we had half the party and that we were very sorry for being late.  Jim rolled his eyes at my boyfriend and said, ""Well I have angry tables that are complaining about the out door tables.""  My boyfriend told him that we could sit inside if people wanted the outdoor tables.  Jim, in a bitchy tone, said ""well i don't know what to tell you!""  We took the outdoor tables that they reserved for us and got everyone out there.  Jim did not bring us any menus and someone in our party went inside and got the menus for everyone.

All of my friends in the Philly area are straight, so we usually end up at any of a number of awesome beer bars and/or dives, which is just fine by me. 

However, I always like to find a spot where I can have a nightcap and at least look at other boykissing boys...and maybe on the rare occasion, to find one I can at least have a normal conversation with (if not invite back to my hotel for a different sort of nightcapping).

Unfortunately, most of the gay bars in Center City are at least as obnoxiously, stereotypically mediocre as the ones in NYC, and I end up wearing my iPod headphones to avoid the insanely loud (and dreadful) thump-thump dance music and slapping away the groping hands of muscle queens, dancing divas, and salacious creeps. I never thought a city could have as many awful, same-ish gay bars as NYC, but Philly most certainly fits the bill.

On my most recent visit, someone suggested a handful of places I should check out. Place number one: a ""sports"" bar with violently loud house music and shirtless bartenders. No thanks. Place number two: an overcrowded mess of clones in too-tight t-shirts and shaved heads, along with slightly less loud but just as awful house music. Again, not even worth approaching the bar to place an order.

Like Goldilocks trying out ursine options, place number three was just right: U Bar!

I had actually stumbled upon this spot a couple of years ago when colleagues and I were on a business trip, and we enjoyed a chill happy hour at the open front windows without even realizing it was a gay bar until it started to fill up with some of its usual clientele. My favorite kind of gay bar is one that doesn't scream ""GAY"" in your face the moment you walk in, so I told myself I'd have to come back...and then I summarily forgot where the joint was.

I'm so glad I was referred back, because both nights I went in (Friday and Saturday) were kind of full, but also pretty friendly. I struck up conversations with strangers without feeling like I was being judged as a ""trick,"" the bartenders and bouncers were pleasant, and--a true blessing--there's a jukebox on which I was able to play Bad Religion, NOFX, and lots of other stuff that nobody fussed about, but which I'm pretty sure would have gotten me chased out of the queenier establishments I'd tiptoed into (and straight out of) on my way there.

The crowd itself is marginal and mediocre. Yep that's the way all the clubs are in ""cc"" philly.


Parking anywhere in the downtown Center City area it is a challenge! Cabs are hard to come by --SEPTA, and public transportation is unreliable.

The Philadelphia parking Authority is ruthless! You can pretty much bet you're going to start out your night in this portion of Philadelphia paying a hefty price for parking! 

The large glass windows around Ubar kind of put you in a fishbowl environment. The crowds are extremely cliquish! 

If you are an ""outsider"" from outside the Philadelphia region,  expect to be treated rudely. Philadelphia has a nasty reputation as a whole for being rude and having nasty attitudes. I was asked in U-Bar by three loval gay guys, ""where are you from."" I responded that ""I'm from Los Angeles, live in Dallas, and work in Philadelphia."" 

One of the three guys said, ""so you're stupid and ignorant because you're from Texas; fake and plastic because you're from Los Angeles."" This exchange occurred between total strangers who is only been talking for just a few minutes! They were unapologetic about their conduct! This level of discourtesy seems to be the hallmark of most clubs in Philadelphia and their Gayborhood! 

Expect to be bombarded with requests to parTy! Drugs seem to be all over the Center City area and gay community in Philadelphia! In the fall of 2013, Philadelphia made national headlines when two gay men were beaten savagely in there gay community by a gang of 12; one of the suspects was the daughter to a local police chief--The Philadelphia district attorney was only able to file criminal charges on three of the 12 suspects involved! PA, at the time have no hate crime laws on the book for the state of Pennsylvania! This clearly tells you how far behind the times Philadelphia is! 

Your personal safety in the Center City area of Philadelphia is a real concern whenever you go into the gayborhood around Ubar! 

If you've never done Philadelphia's gay community and bars;  it's okay to do once or twice--then save your money and go to the Raven in New Hope, PA or NYC! 

If you do U-bar; you won't see much variation in this crowd--the crowd is the same at Woody's, iCandy, and the other bars in the area. You see the all the same faces; all the time; with no variation!",2015-01-09 16:43:22

(Maybe Uncles wasn't really that legendary, but it was definitely there for many years and turned a lot of people into alcoholics in that time, so there's that.) 

But now Uncles is gone, but its legacy lives on in the form of the letter U.

In my mind, though, it will be called R Bar, where the R stands for ""rectangle"".  Because that's all it is.  A rectangular bar.  You walk in, there are four sides to sit down at...and that's it.  No nooks or crannies to explore, no real ambiance other than the windows overlooking the streetscape.  Just a minimalist place to drink.  And that's fine with me.

What I care about is the quality of the Old Fashioned, and U Bar makes a mean Old Fashioned.  I'm not too fussy, but when it comes to Old Fashioneds, I don't want them too sweet or too boozy, and U Bar strikes just the right balance.

We not only understood, but really appreciated the measures this place took with regard to safety (from COVID and CRAZY); Center City has its fair share of ""shade"" at night. From the bouncers, to the manager, to the bartenders, we were welcomed enthusiastically. Small world moment: The bartender/security, Nile, attended the same elementary/middle school as my hubby. Our server the second night, Delilah, was a delight. Though she seemed a bit overwhelmed with the amount of tables, she didn't miss a beat.

It may take them 30 - 40 minutes to get back in. The club is tucked away in a cozy little alley, so as your party spills out of the club they can congregate in front of the bar and be obnoxious!

Sure, people were saying ""Ooof, the years have taken its toll"" and comments had been made that the place had seen better days.  So off Tavern went, shut down for months, and reopened taut, tight, smooth with nary a wrinkle to be seen.  Wait, who the heck are you, Tavern? Where d'ya go?

Don't get me wrong, the renovations are a revelation.  It's so spanking (pun intended) clean.  There were windows added - (hey there's light!), spacious lovely tiled entry, drop ceiling removed, floor plan entirely re-imagined.  New everything.  From flooring, a new refurbished piano, ample circular bar (with bag hooks - thank you! and outlets to charge your electronics), wall treatments - it's like a entirely different place. Which is exactly my problem.  There is nothing about this new place that reminds me or makes me feel like I'm at Tavern.  Apart from the piano, and the tunes, there is nothing that is at all reminiscent of the old place.  I missed the old space.  The drab, dark, dreary dive-y, kitch-y place.  The 80's dance club upstairs.  I loved it as it was.  In my mind, the place was perfect as it was.  There was something comforting about it.  Hidden away on Camac - it was like a place frozen in time.

But onwards, and upwards, what was TOC is no more, and I have to embrace the times, and admit that yes, a little freshening up never hurt anybody - the only obvious change as well, is that the pours have changed, and so their drinks here no longer put me in my place, and well, hey, surgery (ahem) I mean renos don't pay for themselves, you know!",2014-07-02 16:06:17

That was pretty good. The lady playing the piano was really nice and fun. She let patrons come up, request a song, and sing along. 

Wasn't a fan of the 2nd floor bartender. He was really dry. Also, seems like he either charged us more for our drinks or the 3rd floor drinks were cheaper. On the 2nd floor I ordered a caramel apple and a beer and was charged $14 (not bad at all) but on the 3rd floor I ordered a screwdriver and a whiskey on the rocks and was only charged $12. Weird. But either way the drink prices are very reasonable. 

Now on to the third floor. We had an absolute blast. The bartender was great and very friendly. He made nice strong drinks as well.

I was at Tavern on Camac for a friend's birthday and loved everything about it. From the piano man downstairs (with everyone singing along to Abba and showtunes) to the great dance floor, Tavern is just what you want a ""gay"" bar to be. The drinks are strong, the music's good, and everyone is having a great time. If you want to just relax and have a few drinks, the downstairs has a great atmosphere. But when you want to dance and go nuts, the upstairs has you covered with a full bar and great music.

The crowd here is also great. It's a great mix of young and old, gay and straight, that makes everyone feel like they're just out for a no-pressure night out.

I've also got to give props to the no hassle free coat check.

My only two complaints: when it's crowded, there's a line to get up to the floor with the dance floor, and the floor is so packed that you really gotta shove to get a space to dance. Also, the men definitely outnumber the women, so if you're looking for a women scene in the neighborhood, might be better to try Sisters. 

On the plus side: no cover charge, decent drinks (both in taste and price), and (most importantly), on the dance floor, everyone gets fully into the music.

I can't vouch for downstairs, I've never even seen it never mind tried their food, though I've heard positive reviews from others.

And the top floor is... ehhh, I don't know.. mediocre. That's the dance floor but honestly, if you're going to dance at a gay bar, you're probably better off going to Woody's, Pure, or 12th Air, etc...  some place that is more devoted to being a nightclub.  If you go to TOC to dance, you're either the only one on the floor (awkward unless you're tipsy, then pretty fun and freeing actually), or waiting in line on the stairs which I never really understood.  I will say, though, the bartenders upstairs know their stuff & are funny/outgoing.  And it's a cool atmosphere for a place to have a split personality between the floors incase you have sudden mood swings throughout the night.

The piano bar (the floor as soon as you walk in the door) is the reason I go. This is NOT karaoke, so please don't treat it as such. Dont' sing unless you have some semblance of talent or else an overbearing personality/sense of humor that is entertaining to watch.  If there's a song you want to hear...  write it on a napkin and give it to the pianist.  I used to go here in the John Flynn days... who is an A+++ absolutely amazing performer/entertainer, but as I understand he isn't there anymore.  Still,  second best is David West or Max.  I'm not too into Gosha, since she sings all the songs herself and they're too slow & jazzy for my taste, but she has many fans.

I like it for the amazing atmosphere. It's such an awesomely diverse group of people who go, different ages & personalities. I've had the most intense drunkenly philosophical conversations of my life with strangers on the steps of this place.

Ladies, I hope you have strong bladders. There's a single stall (""women's only"") outside of which I've found myself crouching and grabbing my crotch while praying to god I wouldn't piss myself shamelessly for a while only to have the door open with a couple of guys come out.   Come on, TOC, I understand it's ""a gay bar"" but last time I checked there were gay women too, right?  (There's also a bathroom upstairs, so I can't really be too hard on them for this.. but that's usually full or blocked by the line waiting to get to the dance floor).

I'm giving this place 5 stars DESPITE being kicked out the last time for ""being too drunk"" (hello, whose fault is that, mr. amazing bartender?) but really... I just tripped up the stairs! Seriously... yeah.. I was probably a drunken mess who had reached the point of no return but we all have  those nights and I can't hold it against the doormen who are all lovely & just doing their job (and doing it well!)",2010-03-26 02:34:29

I was told gay bars make strong drinks and holy crap they absolutely do.  Lowering inhibitions.  I see what they did there.  Aside from that, it's a pretty chill spot versus all of those other Gayborhood bars, which feels more night-clubby.  I was also surprised to see that they had food.  The rosemary fries were really good, and I ganked a fair amount of them from my friend who ordered it.  It sorta has a taste that's similar to the Colonel's potato wedges, so I think it's safe to say rosemary is probably one of the 11 secret herbs and spices.

On that particular night, it was a playlist, not a DJ so it was mainly club music. I went back on a Saturday night around 10:30pm and there were hardly any people on the 2nd floor, but it was early. I couldn't tell if there was a DJ or not. The bathrooms are fairly clean and not much of a wait, and what everyone said about the prices are correct - mixed drinks are only a dollar or so more than a bottle of beer.

Known for many years as Maxine's, the staff indicates it has been a piano bar since 1935! The modern version is a 3 story venue featuring a splendid mix of everything - great food (small plates, full entrées), a piano bar 7 nights a week with fabulous local entertainers and a small dance floor and bar on the upper floor (3rd level).

The lowest ground / below ground level features the Tavern and is generally the quietest / most intimate space featuring food and drinks at the bar or in the dining room 6 nights a week. Rumor has it, the space once connected to the Underground Railroad.  Generally on weekends when the upper floors are busy, the Tavern room is the only spot for food.  The main level features the piano and a sizeable number of men (usually gay) singling along to old and new classics.  Sometimes it's like you're at a Broadway Show the talent is so spectacular.  It's certain to be busy weekends, but don't be surprised if every seat at the piano is taken on a Monday night too.

On the upper floor, you'll find DJ's and dancing available, but don't expect the massive volume of people jammed into the space as you might at Woody's.  At the TOC, you'll be able to move about and ""usually"" have a conversation at any level.  Sundays is a very popular night with Showtunes starting at 9pm and a large (often wild) crowd singling along the videos from musicals and movies.

If you desire a classic predominantly gay venue, but modern by any standard with a friendly crowd and professional staff, you owe it to yourself to visit TOC.  I have been visiting since June 2014 (after relocating to the East Coast) and much more so now that I live in Philadelphia.  It's a absolute stop when friends visit from out of town.  While I didn't see the space prior to renovations (completed in early 2014), I cannot speak to the former space, but I genuinely enjoy the new space as it exists today.  Open minded people are always welcome, but the venue caters predominantly to the gay community.

If you're dining, I can recommend from personal experience the Fish N Chips, roasted brussel sprouts, chicken sandwich, and on my last visit, the special which was sea scallops over risotto and asparagus - it was delicious!

ToC was probably the first bar I visited after I turned 21.  It was awesome then.  It's continues to be awesome today.

Why?  Because it's casual, unpretentious, and -- most of all -- SO MUCH FUN.

ToC is practically an amusement park, with something for everyone.  The main level has a piano bar with some of the best tunes in town.  The bartenders are sweethearts, the drinks are cheap, and there is *never* a cover.  Want to sing showtunes all night with a bunch of drunk strangers?  I can't think of anywhere else to do it.

The bottom level is Terra, their in-house restaurant.  It already has its own listing on Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/terra-philadelphia), so I won't go into the details here.  Needless to say, Chef Eric's food is superlative, and the staff (especially bartender Tony!) are the coolest guys in the 215.

The top level is the nightclub (its latest moniker: the Ascend Lounge).  On a Wednesday night, I played a naughty version of Family Feud with a bunch of friends.  On a Friday night, I danced 'til close.  The space is small, but the mirrored walls make it feel spacious.  The music and deejays are my favorite -- mostly pop tunes but with an excellent beat.

Sure the dance floor is not very big and you have to go upstairs to get there, but it's still a lot of fun.

My only real complaint is that the bathrooms are set up in an odd way so that any lines end up blocking the stairs and sometimes even winding down them.

I love the new decor.  They did a wonderful job with the design and the space, but there are some unfortunate underlying problems:

1.  By opening up the space, you can't hear the piano anymore.  You can sit four feet from the pianist and can't hear him:  not good.

2.  The open space, while definitely bigger, feels smaller, because there are no more nooks and posts to congregate around.  

3.  TOC was a place to go hang out, listen to the show tunes, and talk to people.  You can't hear who you're talking to, and the setup does not promote conversations.

4.  They went from two bars to one really nice one, but by doing so, they took away seats and jammed everyone into one space that loops out into the middle of the room.  In the past, there was always an interesting split:  quiet older folks interested in the music at the little bar, and younger rowdy folks at the big bar.  That dynamic is gone.

The vibe is still friendly, the staff is still solid, and it's still the best gay bar in Philly.

I'll never forget my first foray into this intense world of mirrored dance floors, Britney remixes, unisex bathrooms, pint glasses of Red Bull Vodka, and dudes.  It was an eye-opening experience.

Most straight guys are missing the point when it comes to gay bars.  They tend to fixate on the superficial, while totally missing out on some real opportunities to rock.  Get over yourself.  You have got to get up to get down.  It's a simple mathematic equation.  

There are TWO fundamental rules that all straight men must abide whilst visiting the Tavern in order to fully maximize their experience:

1)  Don't be afraid.  You will get hit on, that much is guaranteed.  The quarters are tight and there's nowhere to hide.  In fact, although it may seem counterintuitive, the straighter you act, the more suitors you will attract.  I suppose you're viewed as a challenge, a latent ball of homosexuality just begging for a special boy to bring it to the surface.  While we all know this isn't true, you should take advantage of this false belief.  

Instead of being offended when a tiny little man in a tight v-neck tee, True Religion jeans, an out of season tan, and an impeccable complexion approaches you to talk about football, embrace the opportunity.  Live in the moment.  Accept the drink that he has offered to buy you.  If you can simply maintain conversation, that one drink may turn into two drinks which may turn into three drinks...all for free.  Think straight dudes.  How many dollars have you spent in your life buying drinks for girls at bars?  How significant of a return on investment have you seen from those dollars?  Generally speaking, I'd be willing to bet it's pretty low.  So why not recoup some of those sunk costs?  Why not get yours?  Shed your antiquated inhibitions.  It's your turn to feel pretty.  It's your turn to feel special.  It's your turn to feel wanted...sigh!  At Tavern on Camac, for once in my life, I could keep my wallet in my pocket, sit back, and enjoy an evening of lively chatter and free booze.  Take...Ad...Vantage.

2)  Keep your head on a swivel.  While it's fun to get free drinks, it gets a little old as the night draws closer to last call.  At some point, you will have had your fill of dudes night out.  And herein lies the magic of the gay club - a secret fact of life that most of my straight friends are hesitant to believe, but are quick to embrace once they bear witness to this amazing phenomenon.  In Philadelphia, gay bars are the best place to pick up chicks.  

Now wait wait wait.  Take it easy over there.  Allow me to explain.  Every weekend, girls get together with their pack and head out looking for fun.  Invariably, they end up at the same old bars getting hit on by same old guys.  It's gets tiresome.  They need a change of pace.  So what do they do?  They call their gay friend and they set up the classic - GIRLS NIGHT OUT!  ""Whoooo...it's going to be great.  We'll hit the gay bar and dance the night away without having to fear the shady, straight guy, back-end, sneak attack on the dance floor!""

They get all dolled up, they meet up with their gay friend, and do just as they planned.  No straight guys, just girls and gays having fun.  They are easy to spot, dancing in a herd in a circle around their one gay buddy.  That is until midnight hits.  They've had some drinks, they're starting to feel good, and all of a sudden, they realize, they might actually want to meet a nice guy.  You can literally see this switch flip in their brain as they start to frantically scan the dance floor for anything even slightly resembling a straight man.

Well, when that happens, if you're the only straight guy in the gay bar, you start to look pretty damn good.  You have no competition at all.  You could be the biggest loser on the face of the planet, but if you're in the right place at the right time, you could be getting your swerve on.   It's a good thing to be a big fish in a small pond.  Furthermore, it's such a liberating feeling to be able to meet the young ladies without any interference from spiky haired dorks in their t-shirt and blazer combo ala Ryan Seacrest circa 2K5.  The fact is, you can't compete with these tools because they have no sense of shame, so why even try?  Go gay bar and avoid the competition all together!

Most guys don't realize this aspect of the Tavern.  They shy away for no good reason at all.  As a result, they are seriously missing out.  To all my straight men out there, get on over to Tavern, drink for free, and meet some chicks.  Doesn't get any more hetero than that.  

My only word of warning would be to avoid feeding the bears on the first floor.  They're an aggressive bunch and often known for their frugality.  No free drinks here.  Just lots of burly man hugs.",2009-11-25 17:14:15

After having dinner at Knock, my husband wanted to go to Tavern on Camac.  So we went and since we live in Wilmington DE, I could not drink because I needed to drive back to Wilmington.  Our mutual friend, from West Chester met us in Philly and she also had to drive back to West  Chester, ergo, she couldn't drink either.  We, my friend and I had already had one drink with our dinner at Knock.  So my husband was the only one who could drink.  We bought him a drink at Tavern but apparently he was not drinking fast enough and we were not drinking at all because we had to drive.  This did not sit well with the bartender because he approached us and unceremoniously kicked us out of the bar stating ""If you are not going to buy drinks you can't stay here.""    As we exited the bar, I suggested to the security guard that they place signs stating the minimum purchase required and how fast these need to be consumed.

We had bought four drinks there. It was a Thursday night and was not overwhelmingly busy either.

After my friend had calmed down, he was minding his own business and texting on his phone, when the bartender came up and asked us all to leave, claiming that ""his manager would get him in trouble if he saw this."" 

I am outraged by this experience and cannot understand what made this bartender feel like this was an appropriate response to the situation.

Natalie served us our drinks & immediately forced us to close out our tab while she continued to offer drinks to others around the bar and wouldn't look twice in our direction. On top of that, she over poured my girlfriend's drink (a cosmo) to the point where the napkin underneath was drenched and Natalie did not apologize or even bother to clean it up. We took a few napkins and cleaned up the mess ourselves and were even willing to order another drink from her. We looked around the bar and saw many men she mad cosmos for, had the extra bit poured  into a separate glass so it wouldn't go to waste but my girlfriends drink was inappropriately overpoured? It was very clear that she had no interest in serving us. I don't know if she preferred to serve gay men and had something against lesbians?

The restaurant portion of this establishment is downstairs from the actual bar and piano shindig. The door is incredibly difficult to open, resulting in  embarrassment and shame when everyone inside is staring at you struggling to open the door. I'm chuckling at the recollection. 

We were seated at a two top in a slightly awkward location, I had the pleasure of the kitchen entrance in my direct line of vision. The dining room was decorated festively given the holiday season. The place was initially pretty empty upon our arrival at slightly past 7 however towards the end of our stay maybe like around 9, many more tables were occupied. 

The menu contains appetizers, small plates, sandwiches, and entrees. DEVILED EGGS is one of their apps and I absolutely love those little balls of eggy goodness. There's a tiny dollop of sriracha-esque sauce on top of each egg which adds a robust element of flavor. 

We ordered the cheese plate to share. There was a bleu (literally on every single cheese plate on earth, I dare you to find me one that does not include bleu), a brie-like soft cheese, and a very hard cheese I suspect is in the parmesan family. Accompaniments include a few marmalades, bread slices, I think something else that I cannot recall, and prosciutto. The brie was very good but I wasn't head-over-heels for the other two cheeses. The presentation was impressive, I did not waste any time slapping that shit on my insta. 

I ordered a wedge salad with an iceburg lettuce wedge covered in bleu cheese dressing (here we go again), bacon and WITHOUT the onions. Bae ordered one of their burgers and a side salad. Unfortunately, the salad came out absolutely covered in red mother fucking onions so I took them up on their offer to make another one for me. My fiance's burger sat slowly approaching room temperature while I waited. Our actual waiter came over and inquired as to where my meal was and when I told him about the onions he replied, ""that's strange, I definitely asked for it without onions"". Either way, it was annoying. Thankfully the wait wasn't too long and I was served the salad devoid of onions. The diced bacon was entwined with itty bitty pieces of sundried tomatoes which was a nice touch. 

I ordered 2 vodka diets, and tinasaurus ordered a vodka soda first and then a glass of champagne. The mixed drinks are in rocks glasses which is a major pet peeve. 

Our waiter had a strange attitude about him. Maybe it's just a version of RBF? I didn't get a warm and fuzzy feeling. 

My experience was intermediate. I'm not one for conclusions.",2018-12-09 03:25:52

The security guard out front was kind and professional (and vigilantly weeding out fake vax cards! thank goodness!) and the pianists are incredible. I've had nothing but positive interactions with the customers. The drinks are good and very strong. I will probably return again.

HOWEVER!

Last night at the Sondheim memorial, I stood for about 30 minutes at the bar waiting patiently to be served. When I finally got the bartender's attention, I ordered 3 cocktails ($11 each, $33 total) and handed the bartender a $50 bill expecting to get change, and then use that change to tip her, generously. But not as generously as the bartender had in mind! She glanced at the bill, looked me in the eye and said ""Thank you so much,"" in this super grateful, sincere tone. Then she dropped it into the register and went back to ignoring me. I was so stunned by her confidence and the boldness of her assumption, and so tired of struggling to get her attention, that I gave up and took my $50 cocktails back to our table. So awkward! So weird! 

Ultimately it's on me for not saying anything, but I'm a socially anxious guy and I try to avoid confrontation as much as possible. I truly don't think I did anything to suggest the $50 bill was 100% for her, and I don't think I behaved in any way that would have justified screwing me over. I did not rush her, I said please and thank you. The only thing I can think of is that it's because a) I was one of the only people wearing a mask and perhaps that irked her or b) I ordered manhattans, which are admittedly more complicated to make than just handing me a beer, but hey, it's a frickin' cocktail bar. 

I didn't catch the bartender's name, but she looked to be a white woman in her 40s with shoulder length wavy hair. Might have had some gray in it, but it was hard to tell in the low light.

I told her that she shouldn't speak to customers in such a rude way. In response, Christina told me to ""go fuck myself."" My friends and I asked to speak with her manager. Michael, Christina's manager, was called to resolve the problem and issue a refund for our food, which had not yet arrived. Michael took an extremely long time to arrive, as he was busy managing another location. Upon arrival, Michael issued my friends and I a refund, but made a joke out of Christina telling me to ""go fuck myself,"" alleging that I may have deserved it.

The Eggplant Benedict for Sunday brunch is awesome, lightly breadded and tasty eggplant, perfectly poached eggs, served on garlic toast.  Yummy!

3-The nice older bartender with the glasses and the mustache who works days (sorry I forget your name!)  Always pleasant, and always full of funny stories.

I love that the downstairs is basically a cozy neighborhood beer bar and not just a meat market. The way the downstairs was before was such a weird amalgamation of things with basically 2 separate bar areas (one room catered to more of the older crowd, the other room, the young college scene) and I know they used to serve food in a small area on the opposite side of the bar near the coat check. But now the whole first floor has been opened up into one giant pub space that is gorgeous, airy and spacious. They also serve dinner & brunch now as well. And a whopping 32 beers on tap - Hello!? What other gay bar do you know of that can boast that? 

I only wish that the upstairs bars had a better beer selection. No taps in the club & your bottle selection is limited to Yuengling, Miller Lite, Bud Lite, Corona. The music is always great, though. It's just a fun, warm environment that can either be a great place to start or end your night. They do a lot of themed nights and Happy Hour during the week too. (Drag shows, CD release parties, etc)

NB: Ladies, sometimes it can be a little hard to get the attention of the bartenders if you're not a hot, gay man in a v-neck but hey, at least there's never a long wait for the restroom!",2012-04-04 03:30:32

The downstairs bar seems to pull a slightly older, less dance-y crowd on busy nights. Of course, this comes with men old enough to be my grandfather doing their fair share of ass-grabbing and eye-making at the younger patrons. Upstairs can get packed but usually not intolerable, since the dance floor pulls a large crowd. I've never had a problem getting a drink at any of the bars here -- the bartenders are always on top of their game. The drinks are the strongest I've ever had -- which can be both good and bad. I certainly feel like I'm getting my money's worth, since I've paid between $7 and $8 for a well drink here. Certainly not easy on the wallet -- also, they only take cash, like our friend Tavern on Camac. Thankfully, they have an ATM that might very well need a hand crank to operate it downstairs for your convenience.

The dance floor is really only packed on Wednesdays and weekend nights. Wednesdays are ""college night"" so the dance floor is filled with 18-20 year olds and the men who love them. It's no shock that you have to be drunk before you get to the dance floor -- underage kids drink before they get there, and the 21+ crowd makes sure they're good and liquored-up before they leave the bar area. It's really the only way to tollerate the crowd.

The go-go boys are nice eye-candy, but have that ""oh come on now"" quality to them...awkward dancing, stuffed thongs and most of them are clearly straight and cringing at the naive drunk guys trying to take them home. A bit skeevy, too - I once experienced a go-go dancer in the crowded bathroom offer a flash of his junk to anyone willing to tip him $20...I know you gotta' make that money, boo, but really?!

My suggestion is get drunk someplace cheaper first, then go so plastered you won't care who's dancing with you. 

Also, I've never eaten at the restaurant. Quite frankly, the last thing I want to think about while eating is the debauchery that goes on elsewhere in the building.",2011-01-13 00:39:45

Woodys had the sidewalk and street in front of their establishment blocked off. My Lyft driver, not able to get me to Tabu dropped me off on the corner where Woodys is. No issues walking to my destination. As I was walking through the blocked off section of the street I got stopped very rudely and aggressively by one of the African American male bouncers.

He was rude, aggressive and condescending and tossed my purse back at me.

The bar downstairs is great. The large beer selection makes it acceptable for straight men to make a trip to the gayborhood. You also have the option of really strong drinks. Almost too strong. Shh. I didn't say that. 

The upstairs bar has no taps anymore, but is now a dance floor, and it was really fun on a Thursday night. There were a lot of straight people, hence why I think Woody's is now more straight friendly. 

I haven't been to the main dance floor yet or tried the food, but maybe soon.

The craziest night at Woody's tends to be Wednesday - College Night! The Under-21's enter through a side door that leads directly upstairs to the dance floor - which is usually PACKED. I mean sweaty, bumpy, crazy packed. And not just packed with queer kids - there are usually a lot of straight kids too. It's impossible to get a drink, it's impossible to not get spilled on, and it's impossible to find a spot on the dance floor. On the one hand, it's an ego-booster because you're guaranteed to get hit on 5 or 6 times in a night (just because there are so many people there!) ....on the other hand, you may not wanna get hit on by the people you get hit on, and in a sweaty crazy-crowded room there's not too much you can do about it. Go with a big group of friends! Friends make it fun, and friends can be bodyguards too. 

If you are 21 (I was very excited to finally turn 21!) you get to cross the dance floor and go down the other staircase that leads to the bar downstairs. But sadly, the bar's not that much fun. Usually pretty empty, or even if it's full, not too friendly. 

Overall, I have three things to say about Wednsday at Woody's: I wish it were gayer, I wish it were less like a frat party, and I wish it were less sketchy. (Although when I'm over 21 and surrounded by sweaty college kids, I feel pretty sketchy myself!)",2011-01-13 15:38:35

Most of us were happy with the decision, but many did not want to go dancing upstairs and were set on staying at the downstairs bar area. When we got there, was no line even though we arrived 11:00 on a Saturday night. The bouncers at the front door were friendly and greeted us respectfully.

We started downstairs as we were sober, intended to keep it that way. The bartender was attentive and nice, but the bar was expensive; a rum and coke for my girlfriend plus a Yuengling for me came to $13. I also saw my friend's Corona was $6. This is all before tip. Our massive group was split into pieces, with the group of 4 that I came with huddled in a corner. A staff member approached us and asked if we wanted to go upstairs. We all awkwardly declined as it was $10 a head and we weren't in a dancing mood (we never actually are). The staff member asked if we were ever upstairs before and we all shook our heads. He said, ""give it a shot then"" and gave the 5 of us wristbands for free entry upstairs. Telling the rest of our clearly not ""very important people"" friends that we were going upstairs for a bit, we headed up.

There are two dance floors upstairs. The smaller one had more hip-hop songs with poles to dance on, while the bigger one had an elevated dancefloor with an amazing club light display and fog machine. Dancing requires alcohol though, so we got some shots from one of the shirtless bartenders in the boxer briefs. We started with shots of ""Grape Gatorade"" at $10 each and then ""Waffle Shots,"" which the bartender respectfully asked us what was in it and then made it for us (rather than telling us to order something else). I also wondered if the upstairs bars were more expensive, making our wristbands a form of bait and switch, but we had much more fun upstairs and stayed there nearly the entire time.

We had a blast dancing, and several of our friends trickled upstairs to dance with us. Everyone upstairs was having a great time; I even elbowed a girl in the face and after apologizing for my out of control dancing elbows, her and her boyfriend laughed it off. The crowd was fun, but as others have posted, it was 40% girls and 60% guys (40% which were straight like 90% of our group). Ignoring the 4th grade math problem I shamefully posed, if I was gay and looking for an exclusive gay club, I would be disappointed. 

My only complaints are the bathrooms, which are unisex. In theory, they were meant for gay men and women to pee together, but as I stated earlier, girls actually have to share the bathroom with drunk straight guys too. Also, we tried going back downstairs around 1:30am but rude bouncers told us to go the other way. When we came to the ""other way,"" a ruder bouncer yelled to go the ""other way out."" What Dumb and Dumber actually meant was, ""follow the exit signs out of the building,"" which I determined after asking Dumber some critical thinking questions. This is done to prevent crowds flowing back downstairs, but if I was drunker, I'd have no idea how to get out. Also, Woody's is expensive. We spent about $135 for 7 shots, 2 rum and cokes, and a beer. 

tl;dr Woody's is a fun time dancing with a good crowd mixed with heterosexual and homosexual guys and gals. It's also expensive, so pre-game first!",2015-09-13 18:25:36

Well if I didnt get the directions to this place I wouldnt have happened by it.  Walking down the side street behind Rouge (Chancellor St.), and a couple feet down in front of a dumpster is a door on the left that says ""Stir.""

We got to the place and I was like ""okay."" But when we walked in I was like ""okaaaaay.""  I was quite surprised.  The shady looking exterior was transformed into a swank, cool interior. 

Walking in you are right at the main bar which has plenty of seating and nice, friendly bartenders who are very attentive.  Lots of nice art and cool decor.  Walking down a ways from the front are the restrooms a small seating area and then another cool bar area surrounded by bench style seating, and some more cool art.

The atmosphere: you walk down a shady alley and there is a door. Emerge into the door and there is a tasteful, hip, yet not pretentious decor. Who knew that this used to be the Post?? I was able to easily get seats around the front bar, and you can actually hear your conversations with your friends. 

The cilentele: good mix of genders, as opposed to some gay bars which cater to or just seem to appeal to only one.

The bartenders: Funny, friendly, talented. The guy who served me always mixed up more than one glassful for each drink I ordered- and poured me the extra every time. When I got a kir royale, I got a baby bottle of champagne all my own. Then, extra Chambord later, just because! Good, strong drinks. The names are a bit too cute, but they're good drinks, so I can get past that.

The promotions: I signed up for the mailing list, so they've been notifying me about things like Eagles game night (a free shot on every touchdown, what!?) and Ladies' Happy Hour.

This time was a little different, as we'd be bringing people with us, one of whom had never before been to a gay club. 
Well, I have to say - it definitely, much like our previous visits, we were not disappointed. 

I'll start with the DJs not only did they play great music, but they were very much in control of their floor and enforced dance etiquette, something that is severely lacking in too many line dance places.

The layout - the main floor is relatively small, but the overall configuration provides lots of - I'll say - foul territory so that if you want to try and practice the moves off to the side, where you have a bit more room, you can do that comfortably. And while there are relatively few stools and tables, that's fine. There is plenty of other seating around. 

The people - this was the best part, in my opinion. Perhaps it's the fact that we were there in a line dance night, or because it was relatively early, but it all added up to an atmosphere that was pretty chill and very welcoming. It didn't hurt that the ladies I brought with me are all very good dancers, something that didn't escape the notice of the DJS and the other patrons. It created a nice little bond between our group and the rest of the crowd. 

Other - As I mentioned before, for our one friend, it was the first time she had ever been to a gay establishment, and Woody's provided a great introduction and was the perfect example of what a nice night out should be. It was even nice that there is a very good way of telling when line dancing ends and - whatever follows it begins, so we knew exactly to move on to the next part of our evening.

I knew of Woody's long before ever moving here and any time I talk to another gay person about Philadelphia it inevitably comes up, ""Have you been to Woody's??""  Today there are a lot of competing gay dance bars and that's fantastic, but I still will always have a place in my heart for Woody's.  Last night some co-workers were having a happy hour for a departing colleague at Sampan, down the street.  Sampan was noisy and ultra-crowded and refused to reserve a table for our group.  We decided to leave and we went to Woody's instead.  There was so much open space for us and delicious (and inexpensive) Mexican food from the place next door that you could order through Woody's bar.  What a cool idea!  Drinks were extremely reasonably price and it wasn't so loud that we couldn't talk with one another.   I really like the dance floor area upstairs, although music is a little bit hit or miss.  I've had some really great music nights at Woody's and other times when it's the dreaded techno remixes of top 40 songs.  Last night we went up early--at like 7p and there all these absolutely adorable couples doing the waltz to modern music.  It was very cute but not exactly the bump and grind dance floor that it turns into later in the evening.

Most of the evening took place here, and as Seth and I stumbled up those steps, we knew we were in for a treat. I went to college with this guy, never had any classes with him, but we knew mutual friends so I suppose we were destined to hang out at least once in our lives.

There was no cover this evening, and we headed straight for the dance floor. Normally not a dancer, it was dark and crowded enough where nobody was in danger of seeing our terrible moves, and we had a blast. Of course the one thing I enjoyed was not having to wait in line for the bathroom, since the men easily outnumbered the women at this time. Everyone was really friendly, bartenders and bouncers included, but I just recall random people waiting at the bar with you saying 'hi' just because. It was nice to be in that kind of atmosphere, and you weren't creeped out like you would be at other places.

Ended up meeting someone named 'Aaron/Erin' during one of our embarrassing dance sessions, and we ended up dragging this poor new person out with us to a restaurant nearby after our Woody's fun. I don't remember what the name of this 2nd place was, but I do remember the continuation of laughter and smiles. We never found out if Aaron/Erin was male or female, but if you think about it...did it really matter?

I went back to crash at Seth's pad around 5am, and we promised each other we would do this again. Sadly, that never happened, but I'm glad I remember this much of an ultra fun night with good people. 

Also agree with what user Natasha S. said about the diversity throughout this place. Aaron/Erin, Seth and I resembled a Benetton ad-that ended up on the cutting room floor-sitting around afterwards. And I would do it again in a heartbeat, even in my old age.

My friend and I arrived shortly after 11. There was no line so we were able to walk right up to the door. There were two bouncers, so we each handed our IDs over. My guy was friendly and was joking around, and told me to go ahead in and have a great night. At the same time, I heard the other bouncer say ""yeah he can go in, but not her"" (referring to my friend). We assumed he was also kidding around, and we actually laughed for a second until we realized he was serious. We asked why, and his answer was that my friend ""snatched"" her ID back from him and that he did not like it. I'm serious. 

Keep in mind we weren't drunk. We weren't being rowdy. My friend simply took her ID back in a way that he (apparently) didn't like. We still don't know what he even meant, because she didn't take her ID back in any way that would seem aggressive to any reasonable person. I understand that it's a bouncer's job to weed out those who are belligerent or too drunk in order to keep the other patrons safe and maintain order, however this was the most ridiculous thing I had ever heard when entering a bar/club. We waited for a few minutes in disbelief, thinking that MAYBE he actually was joking and was  taking it a little too far. After about ten minutes of standing there and figuring out what to do/where to go next, the bouncer told us we were free to enter. There was no explanation of why he suddenly changed his mind, and certainly no apology for making us wait in the freezing cold for no reason. I can only assume that maybe he came to realize we actually were fine, given how calm we were during the situation.

Anyway--whatever. We went inside and proceeded to have a good time. A nice, spacious bar downstairs (with an overall relaxed atmosphere) and a coat check, which is always convenient. We proceeded upstairs to find two large dance areas. One of them played popular dance music, and we had a great time dancing among the large crowd. 

The other room was a little more reminiscent of a club, with house music and lights. Although later on when we ventured back over, salsa music was playing... it was a pretty odd switch.

Overall seems like a fun spot, but they could certainly get it together a little better at the door.",2016-02-16 01:16:53

This place gets absolutely packed on Friday and Saturday nights, both downstairs in the bar and upstairs on the dance floor. It is very much a gay pretty boy bar with your expected amount of straight girl tag-alongs. 

The first floor features a long oval bar with video screens playing music videos and is basically just a bar. Usually by 1am it gets so packed downstairs its hard to move. The drinks are kind of pricey and nothing special, but thats why you mostly pre-game before going here. Upstairs (cover of $10 before 1:30am) are the dance floors. The main and biggest dance floor plays Top 40 remixes and some EDM, with lots of great lighting and fog effects. The usual DJ on the main floor is awesome and knows how to keep the energy high. Theres also two bars at either end. The second dance floor is a smaller room that plays mostly Hip-Hop/R&B and has a smaller bar and a couple dancing poles for those so inclined. If you are willing to wait till 1:30 to start dancing, they open up the upstairs dance floor for free and it becomes a giant (if unintentional) grind fest because of so many people on the dance floor. Though if you choose to go this route you will only have a half hour to dance as it closes at 2am (stupid state laws).

The fact is that Woody's is pretty much the heart of gay nightlife in Philly. It's an automatic stop on any night of bar-crawling and, often, the only destination of the night. The nightly themes and events mean that there's always something different going on, to keep things interesting. 

The drinks are strong and cheap, the staff is wonderfully friendly, and even the food is pretty damn good. I love places who transition so seamlessly from brunch spot to mid-day restaurant/bar to nightclub, and Woody's does it splendidly.

And, perhaps more importantly of all, it's just where everyone is. If you want to see familiar faces (or new ones), Woody's is a great bet. I never fail to run into someone I know, and I always wind up talking to great new people.",2013-03-03 17:23:00

Anyway, Woody's is my jam. Sure, you could say I'm biased as I have enjoyed years of genuinely fun, happy memories on the dance floor as well countless more I don't remember so well, but overall this is the best place to go out gay in Philadelphia.

Unlike similar establishments sporting go-go dancers, multiple dance floors, large drinks with a 3:1 vodka:cranberry ratio, awesome music, and exposed brick walls, Woody's does not charge a $40 cover. In fact, it's just $5 if you're a member of the 12th Street Gym (and only $10 for everyone else). What a steal!

Not to mention, Woody's recently finished a huge renovation. The facelift was astonishing; I couln't believe how much it changed for the better! They now have huge windows on the first floor, exposed brick walls, a giant center bar, and even new larger glasses that are actually plastic (so they don't break when they fly out of your hand on the dance floor due to extreme dance moves). The bartenders may have gotten a makeover, too... pretty sure.

We ordered well drinks and after the bartender sat them down he says, ""that will be $8 each"". We were kind of stunned and didn't say much.  We had paid $9 a drink at Tavern on Camac the night before with top shelf so we had higher expectations I think.  Then we took the first sip and could not believe it.  The drinks were very weak, tasted like mostly mixer!  I enjoy a good cocktail. I'm not some 22 year old who ""doesn't want to taste the alcohol"". No offense to 22 year olds, I'm sure you want your money's worth too! And yes, I did order the well drinks, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be worth it - especially if I'm paying $8 each! But the thing that drove me over the edge was when he ran my card and the total was $17.60. I know what you're thinking - have I ever heard of tax, BUT if that were the case, then why didn't the bartender say ""that'll be $8.80 each instead of eight dollars each?!? So maddening!!

Playing queer ambassador when visiting friends in Philadelphia, I first decided to check out Sisters, as it is the more theoretically appropriate venue for trying to pick up girls. However! Dancing was bad, and Woody's was v. close by and also not charging a cover by that point in the night (a bit past one.) And what a good decision it was.

Its always cool to stop in at Woody's on a random occasion. There is usually a large crowd after 11pm and weekends are always packed.

The lighting on the dance floor is really intense, especially at 1:45am and a few drinks under your belt. There is also plenty of seating to sit a few songs out and refuel.

I've been regularly going to the dance party called Snacks. Its easily one of the best dance nights I've been to in the city. The night starts out with drinks specials and ends with everyone dancing to great music until last call. From my experiences, it seems like the clientele is usually younger.

I also paid to get into the party, which should have been enough.  He went on to say that even though I paid admission to get into the party, I was expected to buy bottled water.  At a hospitality establishment such as a bar, where people are drinking a lot, this is not only illegal, but completely unsafe and entirely dangerous to people's health.  As it turned out, I was out of cash, so I had to go to the bathroom sink for a drink of water because that manager kept popping up behind me like he was following me around at a distance- it seemed like he wanted to see if I was going to go get water from a different bartender on another floor of the establishment, which struck me as uncalled for and moderately disconcerting.  If I hadn't been with friends, I would have been really uncomfortable.  Not on.  When he yelled at me, he kept saying increasingly aggressive things, and it almost like he wanted to start an incident.

And yes, it's true- the alleyway looks deceptively sketchy. My friends questioned, ""Where are you taking us?!"" as we passed by abandoned buildings and dumpsters. We eventually found Stir's plain, unobtrusive green door, however, and entered its secret world-- a chic bar with lots of young people. Jackpot! 

For the first time in my adventuring through the gayborhood, I'd found a classy, chill bar with people under the age of 35, of varied genders and orientations, all hanging out. I really liked the pop music playing in the background, giving a dose of energy to the otherwise chill scene. The bonus of a dance floor in one of the rooms, too, (with a DJ who listens to requests) gave people the opportunity to dance if they wanted to. In both of the two rooms with bars, however, there was lots of chatting and general hanging out. The only thing I found sort of strange was the medieval battle movie playing on the tv above the bar. 

Oh, and the drinks were great. The names are hilarious, but even better is the delicate fusion of tastes with each creative combination. The bartender was really nice and attentive, too.

Dance Floor = none (the floor by the back bar is 6ft wide, that space is where people must dance when they do dance) 

Long Island Iced Tea = $12 (never paid that much in San Francisco, LA, Chicago)

Strength of Iced Tea = normal to good, but not stiff

""City Savvy and less cheesy"" = not (relative to shopping at the Gap, yes ... but no, the awkward cheesyness of a lot of gay bars where gay people aren't comfortable being gay just permeated this place.  Lame.  There were a few folks in the back that were swanky and probably city savvy, but that's about it.  I left in less than 10 minutes)

Weird Location = not (if an alley defines a location as weird, then I must be at the Gap.  Who writes these reviews on yelp?!  And as far as alleys go, this is a nice one, not too seedy at all, it's more like a small street, just like the oter small streets in downtown Philadelphia)

Straight/Gay Dynamic = not refined enough  (I'm straight and like gay bars where people have moved past the fact that they are gay (Oh EndUp of old in SF, can you please start up a location in Philly, please!) Maybe Stir isnt in a very very gay part of the city, cuz that gawkward yound gay cruisy energy smacked me i the face when I walked in ... dorky dudes at the bar, looking anxiously like they were consciously trying not to look anxious ... oy vey ... nice people, but that awkward dorkiness sucked.  And as a straight guy, I like it when the crowd is more in their skin, that makes it fabulous for all of us  :)

Ghosts of the Post = none  (I read the review that said Stir used to be one helluva seedy wild place.  Well those ghosts have been exorcised ... nada ... nothing ... plain jane)

Music = painful  (although no reviewer that I read claimed that the dance music was spun by savvy dj's using vinyl and spinning funky grooves, I did read that people enjoyed dancing there.  WARNING: if you ever bought your own vinyl records to spin, your brain would explode at Stir due to the utterly painful and exruciating ""Dance Hits Compilation!""-type music they played.  If you have never enjoyed dancing with your eyes closed for over an hour in a group of like-minded folks, then I can absolutely save you some time: do not go to this place.  It is built for those who dont know the difference.  I pray that I can find a good bar in this city, but so far Chicago/SF/LA it is not.  Maybe I should travel up to NYC since good grooves are guaranteed.  The music in this bar is like 50% of dance mucic in these types of bars: it sucks.  But if you dont know the difference, you wouldnt mind at all.)

Infamous: incredulous.  (Twilo is infamous.  EndUp is infamous.  The old Sketch Pad in LA is infamous.  1015 is infamous.  As far as tiny little off-street bars go, this is not a bad place.  If you wanjt to go enjoy some drinks with your self-contained set of friends you could enjoy yourself.  But nothing in here strikes me as worthy of language such as infamous.  What could possibly be infamous?!!!  Music, decor, patronage, bar, staff ... NOTHING could possibly be mistaken for infamous at this place.  Sheesh.  Again, not a bad place to have laughs and some expensive drinks with your friends, but that's all it is.)

Decor = wanting  (They shopped at Ikea.  Reminds me of a new strip mall that has retaurants that are built new and are intended to look authentic.  Theme: swanky.  Swankier than shopping at the Gap, swankier than almost all bars, since most bars dont go for that.  Not swankier than all swanky bars, lower 50th percentile I'd say.  You can see what they are going for, but it looks strained.  I would take visiting friends there for drinks just like i would take them to a dive bar: a place that is fun because you know that it is tacky.)

Overall:  I would go there again to have a happy hour drink with good friends, but I would spend my $12 on a bottle of Trader Joe's wine before I showed up.  Cool: not.  Swanky: not.  Music: unfortunate.

Sorry Stir!

To open with, the owners of the venue are an absolute gem and delight to associate with.
It's wonderful to see people who keep a clean environment, are happy about seeing customers happy, and extend themselves in courteous and professional ways.
I dj'd my first event here last friday and was thrilled with the staff and their dealings with my party people...no drama, no issues, all good vibes.
The service seems to be quick and hassle free.
Drinks are original and have fun names (the big prick...ha! classic)
There's 2 sections to the environment...the front bar and the back bar, which are seperated by the loungey area and bathrooms.
They have a coat check.
dj booth is fun.
color scheme of the bar/club is really really nice and makes for great party  photos.
Stir is a place for everyone from my perspective. 
Even though it is ""gay"" club, anyone with an open mind and a willingness to have fun will, without question, enjoy themselves and feel quite comfortable and happy about stopping in.

Five blocks and seemingly hours of direction-giving later (this off-the-beaten-path-block to this alleyway behind this dumpster...), we arrived at Stir.  [Note: watch out for aggressive beggars outside.  We saw quite a bit of this when a friend went out for a smoke.]

While the outside might lead you to think the worst, the inside atmosphere is fantastic.  Stir is small, but not cramped -- more like intimate.  There was a lot of space to sit at chat with friends at the bar and in the hallway.  Plenty of attractive faces (both patrons and bartenders)...and I'll never argue with that!  The bar menu had plenty of cocktails with fantastically filthy names, and the ones my friends and I ordered were great!  The prices were a little high, but we seemed to be there during one of the few hours per week that Stir doesn't run drink specials (as per what I've read since).  No cover on that particular night though, which is a big win over most places on the other side of Broad.

My favorite thing about Stir?  Finally, an LGBT place that's in Center City but away from the Gayborhood.  Sometimes you're looking for something less crowded and lower-key...even on the weekend.

Woody's upstairs dance spot is a standout. Before Voyeur took over the major bookings, I got to see some amazing techno music from global DJs. I saw Gui Boratto there, which was a staggering booking. Unbelievable.

1) Cash only policy is very 1990's; accept credit cards already
2) The DJs play very little relevant music; instead they play almost exclusively hip-hop music to a predominately white and latino crowd that doesn't want to here hip-hop (I am speaking only about the Friday/Saturday nights)
3) Overpriced well drinks are cheaper in most NYC bars; be prepared for a real rip off on the drinks.  I assume this is how they want to re-coup their renovation expenses.

The sad thing is, Woodys is one of the few options for gays in Philly.  It offers much more square footage than most other bars but 'space' is about the only highlight of the place.  This is what happens when one developer owns the majority of the properties - price fixing and just plain ignorance of what customers want.  

For reference, I am basing this review in comparison to similar bars in NYC, Chicago and Dallas - all places I have lived and experienced first hand.  Philadelphia ranks last and it shouldn't.

I will give credit to the two positives I see about the bar:
1) overall friendly wait-staff/bartenders
2) the recent renovation is a very nice improvement

But the cost of the drinks, the generally lousy music and their inability to upgrade their POS machines to the 21st century and accept credit cards is why this bar ranks so low for me.",2012-01-02 17:45:27

He was hot  by my inexperience. We danced very close and there was a bit of groping. He asked me to come home with him. I said I have to go back with my friends to Jersey. He offered to drive me home the next day. He just wanted to get off. I was like no, but here's my number. There were a few courtesy calls, but he wanted one thing that night. No big deal. 

Woody's has always been a love-hate with me. When planning to go out, I try to go somewhere because I think it tired and played out. After circling the gayborhood, I always end up at Woody's to end the night. Now, under new ownership, Woody's is still the place to be on Wednesdays for the 18 and up crowd upstairs and the chicken hawks downstairs. Thursday is the latin night if you like it a spicy! Friday is your Midtown Village alternative if you do not wish to trek it up to Shampoo for Shaft Fridays.

However, if you're willing to wait until 1:30, then they waive the cover for the second-floor dance floor and you get to go for FREE! As a college student, I'm not ashamed to say that I often eagerly counted down the minutes to make it upstairs. )just note this only leaves you half an hour, as woody's closes at 2am, as mandated by PA state law. 

When you finally make it up the stairs and hear the music blasting, you'll just be like YAAAAAAAAS. if you're into hip hop, then turn right into the smaller dance room. But if you're like me, follow the voice of Rihanna/Kesha/Brittany/Robyn and behold the whole reason to come to woody's.

The music is amazing. I haven't ever been to a club that comes anywhere close. On top of that, there's great effects. Lights, smoke--everything in time to the music. So many great memories here. I've been here with gay friends, straight girl friends, even a straight guy friend came (hmmm...that's a different story). Anyway, there's a good number of straight couples, but they're in the minority. If you go, you will have a good time. It's not glamorous. This is Philly after all. But it's the best option, and I was happy about it

Not a world-class club. But uniquely philly. Check it out!",2014-12-16 23:01:52

First, the bar is neighborhoody and quite friendly.  Lots of regulars hang out there, including myself, and the happy hour prices ($3 well drinks) are probably the best in the Gayborhood.  

Second, unlike a lot of the niche bars, Woody's tends to have a diverse, mixed crowd of different races, ages, sizes, shapes, outlooks, experiences, and pocketbooks.  It's why I find it to be the best gay bar here in the city.

The bartenders are all top notch, and if they're just adequate they're great to simply look at.  The gentlemen now running the kitchen, Tommy D., has revamped the menu and has done a fantastic job of it.

I'd simply say that in any gay bar, or bar for that instance, people have bad days, including staff, and that sometimes a bad vibe just comes in with certain customers.  I always give a place a second chance, and I'd urge anyone to do so if they were not satisfied the first time around.

Bartenders are clueless. I usually am a very generous tipper but when a bartender closes me out immediately after I order my first drink I take that as an insult and feel unwelcome. He told me that they don't allow you to keep a tab open and must close you out although the night before I kept a tab open for a few drinks instead of closing after each drink. This place will always make money because it is a tourist trap. I feel bad that the this is the best Philly has to offer the gay community.

Saturday afternoon in the place had a much more relaxed vibe.  Bartenders were not always on top of what was on the list, but they were friendly and didn't have attitude.  This is a good place to start your night, I believe.  It's lively but not over the top and has a very welcoming feel.

I visit Philly every year and this last time I went to Woody's on a Friday night and I have to say it was not what I expected.  First of all, why are there so many straight women?  Isn't it suppose to be a bar for gay men?  Almost half of the customers were straight women.  Of course everyone should be welcome, but I don't go to gay bars to be around a bunch of straight girls.  At that point I will go to a neighborhood bar and spend less money.  I have never been to a city like Philly where the ""gay bars"" are so saturated with female customers.  Depletes the purpose.  And if you aren't sure whether or not to believe me, check out the photos.  Most are of girls or taken by girls at Woody's.  That should have been a red flag for me right away.  Not really what I expect from a bar for gay men.

I then waited 30 minutes fighting my way to the bar to only leave NOT served.  The bartender kept serving other customers who were coming up to the counter after me, and some even pushed me out of the way (I'm only 5'4 so I'm easily pushed aside).  I tried to directly say something to the bartender but he ignored me.  I did this for about 30 minutes.  I guess the people he knew by name were more important than a new customer?  I tried to tell one of the doormen, they told me I had to go back and wait.  Sorry, 30 minutes was long enough.  I left.

Maybe if you're a Philly local and enjoy a bar with lots of different type of people and can actually get served you will enjoy Woody's, but as a tourist who enjoys bar hopping in gay neighborhoods I have to say this was a terrible experience.

Every time I mention that I'm visiting Philly on Facebook, several people will comment about going to Woody's. So, it must be the place to be . . . at least for a tourist/visitor. 

I have been to Woody's on several occasions and I've always had a good time. I think that the LGBTQ scene is a little more friendly in Philly than that of NYC. I have always been able to meet and chat with different folks while chilling at Woody's. I was glad to see that Woody's pretty much had representation from a variety of people within the LGBTQ. More importantly, you saw intermingling of different types of people. When I arrived 80's music was the main genre of music of choice and most of the clientele was just chilling (I think people were getting their pre-party on). 

The bartenders were pretty nice and seemed to serve drinks at a quick pace. However, I think that patrons of the bar would be better served if there were more than two bartenders on a Friday night. Also, the bar has a great variety of beers (most gay bars will have 4-5 beers on draft), in addition to your standard and specialty cocktails. I was a little disappointed that the bartender told me that I could not start a tab (but this may be more of a Philly thing, because I ran into the same issue at other places in the area). Then added insult to injury, the sketchy ATM did not work. The bartender, I think his name was Tony, was nice enough to ring me up for two beverages and let me get the other one when I was ready (I would have been fine if he just gave me a double).

One cool think about chilling here before 10:30/11 is that you will receive wrist bands for free admission to the dance club.

One good thing about Woody's though, is Dave P's Snacks party on the 1st and 2nd tuesdays of every month.  There's always great music and a more tolerable crowd, as Dave P brings a more chill and relaxed, dare I say, hipster crowd, that just wants to have fun without being in anyone's face.

-don't just go to gay bars
-drink outside of Center City
-have a decent body of experience both in trendy gastropubs and in dive bars

Basically If you're gay and you've moved to Philly from Brooklyn, DC, Boston or any other city that has a similar bar scene this is for you.

First up, realize how few gay bars there are in Philly. Depending on your count there's under 10, and it's been that way a long time. This hasn't been great for cost or general quality in the entire gay scene, and this applies to The Bike Stop as well.

These are some basic rules that apply to all Philadelphia gay bars: since there's so few, they've had a lock on a clientele population for a long time. Basically they dont try very hard, and haven't in years. This is pretty obvious at the bike stop. Most of the bars staff look like they're 40+, and not a great 40+. The music selection hasn't been updated in at least a decade. The interior looks a cross between some kind of camp idea of ""dive kitsch"" and a poorly lit applebees. 

All gay bars are overpriced (at least in Philadelphia). Most bars downtown are overpriced (I'd say everywhere). As a result, Philadelphia gay bars, which are all downtown, have some of the least competitive prices in the city.

The Bike Stop isn't as bad as some, or most, but its prices are a joke compared to the hipster gastropub circuit (The POPE, Good Dog, South Philly Tap Room, Lucky 13, The Cantina etc). What's a bigger joke is the selection. Usually there's a few shitty national ""crafts"", that never change, for about 1-2 bucks more then aforementioned bars would charge.

But who cares, the Bike Stop is a cruising bar right? Well, kind of.

Monday-Thursday the Bike Stop is a no-one-is-fucking-here bar. The entire bar, all four floors (3 + the basement) is a ghost town during the week.

However, on Friday and Saturday it is legitimately packed...but packed with who?

Remember, the staff is mostly old, the music is mostly old and the beer is over priced and not exciting. Also remember that there's been a new gastropub beer bar, with similar prices- but for legitimate craft beer, popping up all over the city about two a year for nearly a decade now. 

Why these bars are relevant is that while they aren't gay bars, they're just about as gay friendly as a bar can be without actually being a gay bar. You can make out with your boyfriend in public at the POPE at 1:30AM and no ones going to give a shit. Basically, you aren't forced to go gay bars anymore and there's a whole expansive world of really cool new bars oriented towards hip young people. And while you can't exactly cruise in them because they majority of the people in them will always be straight, once you start meeting people and knowing who's  who that barrier begins to fall. Grindr and Scruff also help. 

So where do you think the young gay guys are going, the in-crowd competitively priced beer bars in the trendy edge-neighborhoods with cool bartenders and cool music, or the expensive bar run by old people with lame music and shitty beer that costs a lot?

Add in Scruff, Grindr, etc. and the result is that the average age at the bike stop on a Saturday night is now probably somewhere in the mid 40s. That's being kind...honestly, it might be as high as the mid 50s. 

That being said there are reasons to go to the Bike Stop. Their events are often blowouts, and that DOES draw a crowd of 20-somethings and 30 somethings. And getting the fuck off your apps is nice once in awhile.

A general guide for going to the Bike Stop:

-ONLY Friday and Saturday
-Saturday is usually better then Friday
-Try to figure out if something is going on before you go
-Check out the third floor first, that's where the events are. Sometimes they're a bust but they're the biggest draw a diverse and different crowd
-Get liquored up at Tabu (around the corner and BY FAR the cheapest gay bar in Philly) first 
-Watch out in the alley, the bathrooms and the basement, the old guys will grab you and the staff doesn't care",2013-06-13 15:25:40

I just wanted to let that out there, so you know what you're getting into if you read this review.  

The first time I went to the Bike Stop was with one of my best friends in the afternoon.  It's down an alley (so fitting) and when we walked in it's like walking into a super dark cave.  If you are uptight or do not have a sense of humor, then you will not appreciate this place.  In fact, you might be outright offended.  But then again, it's a gay bar known for men wearing leather so I'm sure the uptight wouldn't venture in there. 

When I walked in, I saw that bottled Dogfish 60 min was 5 bucks, which is a bargain in this city.  I sat down with my friend and did some SERIOUS people watching.  The bartender was in his under ware with some leather straps around his chest.  Some other people were dressed like him as well, then others in street clothes.  It's pretty hilarious to see all age ranges and different types mingling in here.  It's also nice to have none of them paying any attention to you!

On the screen behind the bar is what could best be described as gay porn.  It's photos of guys naked, etc.  At some point in the night a bunch of guys just stripped down to almost nudity and walked around.   It's for sure an ""anything goes"" bar.  The downstairs got really busy as well and I believe my friend told me that each floor stands for something, but I can't really remember what.  

Anyway, clearly I would never hang out at this spot on the regular, but when the occasion arises, I wouldn't give up the chance to see this freak show.  Is it sleeszy?  yes.  Is it very divey?  yes.  Are there strong, cheap drinks? yes.  If you want something upscale, there's always Tavern!",2013-04-25 16:27:02

It was always comfortable and (if not absolutely packed with wall to wall people) you could find a place to sit.  However, it did need to be updated.  The bar is over thirty years old.  Therefore, the renovations were needed . Unfortunately, my excitement to see the new renovations quickly diminished upon entering for the first time since the remodel.  

First of all, I believe this is a gay bar. What is up with the free beer signs on the wall?  It cheapens the entire room.  I think the Philadelphia crowd is a little more sophisticated and would appreciate a different decor.  However, if it is no longer a gay bar then I stand corrected.

The new owners of Woody's did open up the space which was a good idea.  However, since they changed the upstairs bar to a mini dance floor, they removed seats for customers to comfortably sit and have a good conversation.  In addition, they failed to create more seating in the downstairs main bar.  Are the new owners  STUPID?  Since when do you take a successful bar that could use additional bar space and seats, and do the complete opposite?  I guess the one good thing is it will be easier to leave the new Woody's when you can't get a seat because it no longer needs to packed for all the seats to be taken. It will also be easier to get the the front door since they opened the place up. 

 If the new design for Woody's was not the owner's idea, then the person who came up with the new look should be fired.  If you hired someone to design the renovations, get your money back.  It did not think a designer could do worse than Bobby Trendy the interior designer from the Anna Nicole Show.  However, the new owners of Woody's proved it is possible. If it was the new owner's idea, then cut your losses and sell the bar back to Bill Wood.  Maybe he can save it before you run the business into the ground.

It was always comfortable and (if not absolutely packed with wall to wall people) you could find a place to sit. However, it did need to be updated. The bar is over thirty years old. Therefore, the renovations were needed. Unfortunately, my excitement to see the new renovations quickly diminished upon entering for the first time since the remodel. 

First of all, I believe this is a gay bar. What is up with the free beer signs on the wall? It cheapens the entire room. I think the Philadelphia crowd is a little more sophisticated and would appreciate a different decor. However, if it is no longer a gay bar then I stand corrected.

The new owners of Woody's did open up the space which was a good idea. However, since they changed the upstairs bar to a mini dance floor, they removed seats for customers to comfortably sit and have a good conversation. In addition, they failed to create more seating in the downstairs main bar. Are the new owners STUPID? Since when do you take a successful bar that could use additional bar space and seats, and do the complete opposite? I guess the one good thing is it will be easier to leave the new Woody's when you can't get a seat because it no longer needs to be packed for all the seats to be taken. It will also be easier to get to the front door since they opened the place up. 

If the new design for Woody's was not the owner's idea, then the person who came up with the new look should be fired. If you hired someone to design the renovations, get your money back. It did not think a designer could do worse than Bobby Trendy the interior designer from the Anna Nicole Show. However, the new owners of Woody's proved it is possible. If it was the new owner's idea, then cut your losses and sell the bar back to Bill Wood. Maybe he can save it before you run the business into the ground.

To make a long story short, this place sucks.

The name alone - Woody's - is your first clue. Like other entertainment venues of its ilk, Woody's lives and thrives unashamedly in the era of T.G.I. Friday's bar-with-an apostrophe 's'. So, don't be surprised when you step through the lavish rainbow sails and find yourself inside what is every lick an early 90s lolly. 

Upon entry I noticed that all heads were fixated 'video bar'-style on each of four corners, where teeny 19""-ish monitors treated the crowd to an unambitious and wholly undiscoverable ""club"" music mix that frankly is only known to these very type of TV monitors, and only in gay bars. (Of the Kristine W. variety, only even less well known.) Twenty years of personal research confirms this.

Next up: The bold appearance of that indescribably specific lesbian hairstyle. It was everywhere, showing its shagged self on head after head after strong-shouldered, feathery lady-head. 

An hour in: the music videos stopped, and out popped that Sony INSERT A DVD blue screen that made the moment feel ... so unsmooth. Like having to stop your make-out session to change the CD. Soon enough however some fresh-faced bartender rushed beyond the EMPLOYEES ONLY door (where of course I was leaning) ... and within moments the screens were alight with another weird, unheard-of popstress video. We were back in business.

Two hours in: a neck ringed in puka shells (?!); a dude with a shirt that said ""Bay Area"" (that would sort of be like a shirt that said ""Tri-State Area"" or ""Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington MSA""); and an ambitious older gentleman who kept appearing wherever I happened to be.

Three hours in: a moment's canoodle. It was innocent, y'all.

The only thing missing was a bit of C&C Music Factory. Everybody, everybody -- that would have made my hallucination complete.

When you go, seek out the dark and handsome bartender with that romance-novel cover look -- he's a doll, and he mixed me several perfect (and strrrong) drinks. At $10 a pop (I went top shelf), I was most appreciative.

Now, before I disappoint: I cannot report on the dance floor. I understand it's a critical part of the Woody's experience; I just wasn't feelin' the beat. And anyway, let's count our blessings: because middle-aged trolls such as myself have NO BUSINESS appearing on or around dance floors - or frankly, on or around any scene that begins one or more hours after Denny's Early Bird Special. I leave this important task to younger generations.

We had the misfortune of tumbling into this place one Saturday on a relatively busy night, with good times on our minds. But it was crowded with hardly any space to move. The night had other plans.

The first bad sign was that the bar wouldn't allow us to pay for drinks by using a card, which meant we had to forage for $35 among us in bills to pay for the drinks. But the main let down was how apathetic and rude the staff was. 

My friend, a girl, got asked to leave for some unjustified reason: I tried to bounce her into some guy I wanted her to flirt with, she missed his target area and landed on the floor instead. I picked her up. We all laughed -- haha, what good times are made of, but then comes swooping down mother b****, the rude security who informed my friend that ""baby girl you gotta leave, you're too drunk."" We naturally protested, because none of us were drunk and the circumstances had a hilarious explanation. Lady diva security told me, in my adorable pleading for my friend, to shut the [expletive] up -- and became despicably arrogant, surprising us and breaking our good mood. Is it okay to curse at patrons? Of course, we all decided to leave. The experience was bitter because the place had no character to it. 

Fortunately, just across the street to the right is a MUCH better gay club, (4 dance floors!) which we would nearly have missed out on if we weren't ejected from Woody's by gangsta security staff.

While visiting Philadelphia this past week we made the obligatory stop at Woody's.  When entering I was asked to produce my ID, being nearly 50 I was honoured.  I showed my British Columbia, Canada's driver's licence. Let me start by stating I'm a US citizen who lives as a Permanent Resident in Canada.  With great scrutiny the doorman poured over it and said ""do you have your passport with you?""  I asked why and he told me he's allowed to ask for additional identification.  I produced my US Government issued NEXUS card.  ""What's this?"" ""It's a NEXUS card? It's issued by US Customs and Border Protection to US & Canadian citizens who are identified as low risk travelers. It identifies my gender, DOB, and has a photo.  It allows me to travel back and forth across the border without hindrance.""  ""That's not an acceptable form of ID"" I was told.  So then I produced my US Passport Card (credit card sized RF'd used for land and sea crossings).  ""What's this?""  I said ""It's my passport."" I said.  ""This isn't a passport"" said the door man. ""Are you kidding me? You've asked me for ID I've given you 3 pieces of Government issued IDs (two issued by Uncle Sam) and you're still not convinced I am who I am oh and I'm nearly 50.""

Woody's Management - Try educating your staff on acceptable forms of Government Issued ID's.  Furthermore try and train them on customer service while you're at it.

You feel the cold hand and wonder if he's into fisting
You close your eyes and hope that this is more than masturbation

All thru the night I'll slave you into something hot and lean 
A sex machine

The midnite special comes w/ a shot
Leather cruisin' can be fun
Though it's not for everyone
Some will sport a lumberjack
Or the hair that's on their back
I'll stand and pace like in a cell
I'm under some erotic spell

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk from some forty-something bear
Big grizzly guys will make it soon
Hard to move around this room
And though you want to get a drink
Your body knows not wether 
You're itching cause you can't resist

My friends and I had a great time, but we left thinking - ok, well, that was fun, but let's not go back for another 25 years or so. In 25 years, it will be just the place. But then I was talking about Stir with a friend and learned that she had a completely different experience. We decided to go back and give it another look. So, it turns out, that Saturday must have been a special night, because when I went back (on a Tuesday) the crowd was much younger. That said, on both occasions I was very pleased by the seemingly even distribution of men and women, a true gay AND lesbian bar, and to see a variety of ages together. 

Now about the drinks: they're different, which is fun. At happy hour ($2 off!) I tried something called The Sticky Fingers, which tasted like both Christmas and an appletini at the same time so naturally I was pleased. I ended up getting The Sticky Fingers because when I asked the bartender for The Angry Beaver, he told me I wouldn't like it. I asked him why, he said it's nasty and nobody likes it. So I ordered The Sticky Fingers instead. Hmmmm. If no one likes it then why is it on the menu?

Visited the bar over the weekend with some friends and purchased 1 drink downstairs. The bartender swiped my card and then intentionally handed me a receipt with someone else's identical-looking bank card. They kept my card behind the bar and DRAINED MY ENTIRE ACCOUNT within seconds. 

I didn't realize the card mixup until the next day. The bank informed me this was not the first time Woody's staff have scammed their straight female patrons. There have been a number of similar cases in the past year, which leads investigators to believe this was an orchestrated effort within the bar's management.

What started out as a fun Saturday night in Philly ended with a headache of a Sunday morning cancelling cards, calling the police and filing several claims.

The Bike Stop isn't your typical Gayborhood bar, and tonight isn't your typical Gayborhood night. In a far corner, a young man talks on his cell phone, wearing nothing but black sneakers, tube socks and underwear. I try not to stare but that's sorta the point of the monthly BULGE party, hosted by Butch from In Bed With Butch.

The dress du jour is undies only, but there are no spikey-haired skinny boys in silk boxers and UGG boots dancing to Christina Aguilera. Rather, there are shirtless bartenders and patrons with Fu Manchu moustaches, beards, beer bellies and, oh God, grandpa? A white-haired man with a fuzzy chest saunters up from downstairs, aka The Pit Stop, and I can't help but wish his whities weren't so tightie.

I'm denied.

Just happen to stumble into it as this was like our 4th or 5th location of the night.. But we LOVED it! There was a little bit of a line when we first got there... and we were there pretty early on a Saturday Night.. i think around 9. IDs checked and got a little pat down.. and then went inside.

Ambience inside was a chill type vibe. Clean and very open, like even if it were crowded, I wouldn't feel too cramped. Dark but with good lighting. Enough to be able to see the menu. Music was great and not too loud. You can still hold a conversation or enjoy the music and dance or sing along. We sat at the bar and they had a number of beers on tap, lots of options for hard liquor to make cocktails and also bar food like chicken tenders, hot dogs, tator tots etc, enough to get your munchies on to soak up all the alcohol. Word has it the food is AWESOME, so go check it out. 

So the funny thing that I enjoyed the most about this bar was the music and the music videos that were playing on TVs at the bar. It brought me back to the 90s when TRL request Live was the thing on MTV and you watched all your favorite music videos!

I say this because they don't really make their way around the circular bar often enough to ensure that the patrons are able to get a drink.

Stir is such a cool little bar that it might even make a convert out of 007 himself.

Located on a dark alleyway off of Rittenhouse Square, Stir is really two bars in one.  In front is a darker, more rustic bar with lots of brick and TVs playing entertaining music videos.  In back is a light and bright bar, with colorful walls and more of a party vibe.  Are you a schizophrenic drinker?  Then Stir is the right bar for you.

The drinks here are fine, though they don't pack the wallop that they do at Woody's or Tavern on Camac.  My gin and soda was mostly soda.  But this is Rittenhouse Square, after all -- and everybody is on their best behavior on the west side of Broad St.  (Pinkies up!)

The crowd mostly consists of locals who are very serious drinkers.  Not a whole lot of mingling seems to happen at Stir.  On the nights that I visited, Stir was jam-packed with people, yet it was strangely quiet in there.  I guess the boys of Stir don't want anybody getting in between them, their cocktails, and their iPhones.  

While the quiet may be off-putting to some, Stir might be the right place for you if you're looking to catch up with a friend with minimum chaos in the background.

I suppose the ambiance just adds to the mystery.

We ordered two orders of wings from Aleksander our bartender. One of his coworkers mentioned to him that today is 50cent wings day. I ordered two orders of wings and a couple drinks. At the end of the night I asked for the tab. I noticed that I was charged full price for two ordered of wings. I mentioned it to Aleksander that the wings are 50cents. He immediately got defensive and said no they are not!! I pointed to the tv monitor where it clearly advertised that wings are 50 cents on Monday's and Tuesdays. He then replied with ""well how many wings did you have?"" I told him I don't know I ordered two ordered of wings. However many wings are in each order is what I had. He said ""well I can't help you and I'm gonna charge you the full amount."" I immediately looked at my friends and another stranger who was next to me who said ""he's tryna rob you!"". I know I wasn't crazy. Aleksander was very standoff-ish at the fact that I called him out on his discrepancy. He then called another bartender who intervened and asked the problem. I explained the situation and Aleksander interjected saying he wouldn't help me because I wouldn't tell him how many wings I had and he claimed I was being aggressive. I am a half black half Asian male who weighs 115 pounds. How could I be aggressive to a strongly built male who is almost 2 times my weight? I then repeated my original statement that I had two orders of wings and I don't know how many wings were in each basket. I would think that the workers would know how many wings are served in each basket of wings.  It seems none of the bartenders knew it was 50 cent wings. The new guy was actually very helpful after I showed him the monitor where it says 50 cent wings.  He eventually honored the 50 cent and charged me for the two basket of wings that I ordered. All this could have been avoided if Aleksander was a much more customer oriented bartender. I am a flight attendant and I know how to de-escalate situations.

A friend had been asking me to go for the longest time and I finally gave in to his insistent requests.  It was simultaneously strange, terrifying, and intriguing.  I can confidently say, I spent a week here one night.  

To my untrained, heterosexual eye, it was almost too cliché to be real.  Here in this giant space was everything that I had ever heard about gay bars.  An amalgamation of sweaty stereotypes threatening to derail my first foray into the world of the unabashedly gay.  Bartenders bedecked in nothing but tight jeans and red suspenders pouring drinks of unimaginable strength.  A dance floor swollen with dudes, grinding provocatively to ear-shattering house music, a cloud of perspiration hanging heavy over the festivities.  Creepy old guys lurking in the shadows, heads perpetually on a swivel to check out each and every posterior that passed their line of sight, blatant in their refusal to hide their intentions.  

My first instinct was to run away.  It was sensory overload to the max.  The Birdcage was fun, light-hearted, and colorful.  Woody's was dark, aggressive, and threatening.  Once again, Hollywood had lied to me.

However, at the urging of my friend, I stood tall, eased in, and decided to ride strong into the Bacchanalian storm before me.  When in Rome, as they say.  We got after it in true Party Monster style.  

The last thing I remember, before waking up two hours late for work the next morning, was downing a Tequila shot with a middle-aged man who purred that I reminded him of his dead boyfriend, grabbing my friend, and running out into the street, overcome by fits of hysterical laughter.  

My headache was brutal, but I was glad that I had ignored my ill-founded reservations and given Woody's a chance to shine.  I've been back a couple of times since, but it never again lived up to the original hype.

Friends I spoke to after that first night acted as if I had miraculously survived a safari in some distant, primal country where beauty and danger constantly vie for one's attentions.  

Hands over mouths, audible gasps, eyes wide with surprise, they'd all say, ""You went to Woody's?!?!?  And you're ok?"", as if they half-expected me to be missing an arm.

I appreciated the list of fall drinks and tried the apple martini, after some convincing from the very nice bartender, the drink was quite good and also quite strong.

The crowd is always relatively mixed, but the gay men typically outdo the everything else category. Men, women, gay, straight, bi...they're all there though, so don't worry. Located in an alley coated with restaurant kitchen grease, you'd probably not expect much, but prepare to be impressed, the interior is swank, clean, and respectable. 

For those of you on the prowl, who think Woody's/Bump/Pure/Sisters is too obvious, check out Stir. Chances are there's someone there just like you who's classier, more city savvy, and less cheesy than the rest of them.

I was so disappointed. The doormen were obnoxious, actually rude, and egos beyond imagination; they seated me, every time at a table that wobbled a lot, three different tables on three separate visits, each time tipping a minimum of $5 for the seating. Because of the pandemic, you had to be seated at tables, not at the bar, although they were right against the bar. Each time the table wobbled, spilling the expensive, overpriced cosmopolitans. Service was slow, and the server was friendly, never said his name, served drinks with no Bev naps and took forever to clean up spills caused from the wobbling table as he sat the drinks down. I moved my glasses and Powerbeats Pro to the bar I was right against to prevent them from being bathed in my drink spillage.
Sure enough, on the last visit, they were gone. I second-guessed I left them in the car, glasses fog from masks and the power beats pro with over the ear clips are effected by the removal of your mask; however they are in my photos. I only had two drinks each visit, so I wasn't drunk, but both the $800.00 Nike prescription glasses and the $250.00 Powerbeats were gone when I left. I checked the car, and when they weren't there, I went back, and it was just after 11. I knocked, and I was told through a crack in the door to fill out an online form for lost and found, not being let in to get them. Still today, there is no sign of them, and I have heard nothing from them. The drink tasted good, but the environment and service made them not worth it. I still tipped the server well since they were there, and I always take care of service people, especially during a pandemic. I was required to order food, pandemic rule so I did, and it was only fair and served with no napkin. When leaving the third time, I told the doormen, next time, maybe you can seat me at a table that doesn't wobble, and the two of them looked at each other and made a face, not saying anything. I would have expected my tips would at least result in an apology. There is obviously no management here and no sense of responsibility. I travel a good bit, and in other cities, the LGBT establishments have more class than the others, definitely not here! The lack of having my glasses and Powerbeats returned, or at least hearing from them, is disappointing. There was a bartender behind the bar where I sat them, I was right next to the service bar, and the place was not busy, but to hear nothing from management, like we checked the video or anything, tells me stealing from the customer is not only that they don't care but its how they do business.",2021-05-09 16:19:40

The most disheartening about this experience is that the doorman was also a person of color. First, there was not a crowd of people at the door. Doorman ask us to walk around behind the ropes, and insistent to see our ID, and proceeded to frisk us and look into our bags. After I noticed that the white girl he let in just before us, he never ask her to walk around behind the ropes nor frisk her nor look into her purse. I ask way don't you pat her down. He said; ""I don't a sexual harassment allegations"". I said: ""I could say the same for me"". He said ""yes you could, but I want let you in"". After all if this we grudgingly went in, because my friend was meeting other friends (By the way; who also experienced bigotry). I never felt so adamant to write a negative review until now.

On my most recent visit, I was sitting there with a friend, getting him drunk to celebrate his birthday, and they were playing a rather extended version of David Bowie's ""Rebel Rebel"" which magically turned into Daft Punk's ""Rollin' & Scratchin'"" and me, being the sentimental retard that I am, seriously I almost began crying, I had to fight back tears... First things first, a few years ago Daft Punk's sophomore album Discovery (from which this song does not come) got me through some hard times -- I remember myself going up to this very same DJ booth and screaming during some god awful Madonna or Britney Spears crap  ""PLAY DAFT PUNK!"" Secondly, a few years before this Daft Punk's debut album Homework (from which this song does come) got me through some even rougher times... So, basically, the circle was completed -- and boy was it blisteringly loud -- ah, beautiful coincidence and catharsis.

What was I talking about? Oh yeah, I remember -- Woody's, the stink-hole that I adore so much... Downstairs it's pretty much always tragic, and every time I'm upstairs I'm always astonished how the floor hasn't caved in, you can literally feel soft spots through the carpets and when the dance-floor's packed there have been multiple instances where I could swear I felt the floor swaying ever-so-slightly...

For some reason, what I pictured Stir to look like and what it actually looked like were two very different things. I had imagined a wall of dark brick and a long chestnut bar with little space to maneuver. What I got was a square bar in the center of a cozy room, plus another bar with more space in the back, and very tasteful décor all around. Added to that was a 'tender who knew how to make a martini just as well as he made every one of us Stir newbs feel welcome.

This is a three-level bar. The top bar is more of some kind of low rent sleazy sports bar. The main floor that you walk into off the street is very dark--I consider this to be a blessing because the crowd isn't much to look at! You won't see gym rats frequenting this place--and there's a gym right around the corner! 

The bottom floor basement is very small. It usually gets busy after about 10 PM. This is very much Philadelphia's answer to the Levi leather scene. It's not a really attractive answer at all.

I can't quite put my finger on it.  After all, Woody's is an awesome bar.  It's right smack dab in the middle of the 13th St strip, and all roads seem to lead there.  It was renovated back in 2011, and the dingy old Woody's of the past has been replaced with a modern (but rustic) space, with lots of woods and red brick and flat-screen TVs playing Kylie videos on endless repeat.

The drinks are certainly amazing.  It's mostly a beer bar nowadays, but their gin and sodas are the strongest in Philadelphia.  The bartenders are some of the friendliest dudes in town -- all smiles, all the time.  Cash only, but the prices are very reasonable.

Even the food is first-rate.  Woody's hot sandwiches are delicious (especially the roast beef and meatball subs) -- although they're a total mess to eat.  But if you're looking for greasy goodness to sop up the booze, you can't go wrong.

Here is what happened last night:  I paid $10 to go upstairs to dance, and I'll usually head to the bathroom in the first hallway before going to the dance floor.  That bathroom is very small (2 stalls, one urinal, but very little space otherwise.  I opened the door and it was strangely, uncomfortable packed with guys, and I couldn't even open the door all the way.  So, I figured I would wait against the wall in the hallway until a few guys came out.  Woody's often has 1 or 2 guys standing in that hallway who act as ""hall monitors,"" trying to prevent people from hovering and crowding the hallway to ensure the flow of people is smooth, which is fine, but last night as soon as I leaned against the wall to wait for the bathroom, the monitor guy, who looked kind of like Kevin Hart, leaned in towards me and YELLED at me, and told me to ""get out of the hallway!""  I was taken aback, as I know he watched and saw me open the door to see it crowded full of guys waiting to use a toilet/urinal. I tried explaining to him that I couldn't go into the bathroom because it was full--I wouldn't fit in there.  

""Excuse me, ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME? GET IN THE BATHROOM OR GET OUT OF HERE!!""  That was his response.  Actually a little scared at this point, I open the door and squeeze myself into the bathroom, to find that there are about 7 guys huddled together like sardines, because that hall monitor forced them all in there too.  We spent the next 10 minutes commiserating about the awful hall monitor, and about how Woody's is just going downhill in general.  When it was finally my turn to use the toilet in a stall, I couldn't even close the door because there were too many guys in the bathroom and there were literally guys standing in my stall while I tried to pee.  

That was ridiculous...I felt like I was treated like an animal last night.  To the Woody's management, if you ever see this: I'm so disappointed in you.  Hiring angry (and probably, straight) men who treat your patrons like complete sh*t.  We go to Woody's because we don't feel comfortable going to straight bars, and some of us have nowhere else to go.  I can't go back to Woody's after this (and other reasons).

This used to be our playground - growing up in Philly, it was the place to see and be seen for we gay men. Everywhere else had their niche, but paled in comparison to the almighty Woody's. Every night was a specific theme night in the main dance area - whether it was country, disco, club, latino, teeny-boppers, etc.

The ground-floor bar was renovated into a wide open space a few years ago, and certainly is nice in the summer when they can fully open their fronting glass doors/windows. The upstairs contains two dance areas, an all-out large one, and a more classy lounge-type smaller one. So far so good, I count the renovations as a great improvement. 

But Woody's quit serving their delicious food a while back after Bill Wood sold it (thankfully Bill created 'Knock', a dinner bar to serve his food). Also, Woody's more/less kicked out the cool Friday/Sunday night line dancers, which always used to draw huge crowds. And further, the dance areas now cost $10 to get into on weekends - seriously?!!

With the past decade of hordes of people moving back into the City, Woody's has become infested by amateur, new city dwelling straight couples and puking bachelorettes. Ugh - who wants to see straight couples making out in our gay bars? Not I or other gay guys! The bachelorettes would best be served moving over to the Toasted Walnut!

I was thrown out of the bar for letting the workers know that their toilet was clogged and recommended that they fix it or they were going to have a flood soon.  I even offered to do it (I am a helper)  
I was then told that I was drunk and needed to go.  
I may have been intoxicated (I was at a bar, had 4 drinks (2 beers and two club vodkas) in the last 4 hours and had then moved on to water because i try to be responsible and had to work the next day. 
When I explained that I wasn't drunk and did not think that being thrown out was acceptable he told me that i was slurring my words (not true) and that I was wobbling (no, i had six inch heels on i'd like to see him walk perfect in those when tipsy not to mention i am incredibly clumsy).  



When asked to speak with a manager someone who was dressed in the same uniform he was claimed that they were. (which i doubt, managers shouldn't match their employees or should have some form of identification. )

I was also told to put my drink down, when i informed the man that it was just water he commented that he did not believe me.  (rude)

He was harsh with his words and told me to find my friends because they were going too. When i refused to get my friends kicked out for no reason I was escorted out by three people(which seemed unnecessary because i wasn't being violent or hard to handle and i am a petite women). 

They wouldn't let me get my coat from coat check and I was left shivering waiting in the cold alone around 1:15 am.

I just realized that the latest five (!!) reviews of the Bike Stop has been by women, so this gay bar's yelping needs some testosterone.  Bike stop is  Philly's leather and bear bar that has been separated into four floors.

It can be hidden, so just walk on Walnut between 11th and 12th, and then turn into the alley on the south side between Moriarty's and the Theatre, you'll find a bar flying a rainbow flag, a leather pride flag and a bear pride flag. If it's night time there will be from 3-15 guys chatting and smoking outside of the establishment and they will stare at you but awkwardly not say hello typically, this is just the outside ambience. Just go in.  Doorman is always friendlier.

3. The top floor is reserved for private events typically and not usually open.
2. The Short Stop, the sports bar and where you can shoot pool.
1. The Bike Stop, the standard bar where you can get your drink on (typical habitat of the bears)
B. The Pit Stop, the cruisy dim-lit basement only open on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from 10pm-2am (and don't bother them to get it to open earlier, it's just annoying and useless).

The ambience is not like a typical gay bar. It is the Philly version of an Eagle (obviously there might be copyright issues if someone had a bar called the Philadelphia Eagle). For the uninformed, this means the bar caters to leather and bear communities.  Very chill atmosphere and non-judging.  You can be who you want to be, as long as that is not an annoying crazy that wants to vogue in the middle of the bar and spill everyone's drink (hint: go to Voyeur).

Women are definitely welcome to this place, though some regulars may judge, it's their problem.  

Monday is Jockstrap night in the Pit Stop, so wear one under your clothes and then strip if you so desire. Haven't been there for this so don't know what it's like. Wednesday is Underwear night (haven't been either, so don't know).  

There's a no cologne policy in the pit stop. And the pit stop isn't as intimidating as it sounds, it's actually pretty chill, just kind of a nice bar with dim lighting and somewhat cruisy with guys.  

The bar isn't a sex club.

If you want a relaxed bar though and don't want to deal with the vanities of a typical gay bar, this is for you though. People are from all walks of life here, and it's refreshing to see that.",2010-08-18 03:20:40

I ask the bartender how much a Bacardi and coke was and he tells me this exorbitant price. They have a menu of 5$ drinks which didn't make sense. I ordered a 5$ martini instead. The bartender tries to tell me that the security is for my safety. I tell him that they are the only bar that does that so it is actually showing the opposite. He said he would get the manager so I can let him know how I see it from a tourist perspective. The bartender was prompt at asking is what to drink.

The best thing about any bar in my opinion is the people. It's just cool here. Woodys does have an upstairs and I believe they charge a $10 cover. They're also connected to Globar, which I've never been to. As of recent I believe they've removed most of the bar seating - perhaps due to covid.
